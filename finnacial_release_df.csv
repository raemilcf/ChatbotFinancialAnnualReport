3,11,ceo’s message to shareholders,president and ceo,intro,"ceo’s message to shareholders fellow shareholders, it has been one year since scotiabank launched its new enterprise strategy at our investor day in december 2023, where we unveiled our bold new vision: to be our clients’ most trusted financial partner and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. one year into our execution, i can confidently say that we are making progress in doing what we said we would do. while it is still early days and there is more hard work ahead, we are advancing against the key priorities outlined in our strategy, including focusing on deposit growth and purposeful capital allocation. we are strengthening our balance sheet, including reducing our wholesale funding requirement, maintaining strong liquidity metrics, and increasing our common equity tier 1 ratio. and we have been disciplined in how and where we allocate capital, investing in those areas that will drive growth for the bank, while optimizing existing capital in those markets that have seen lower returns. we also introduced a new culture framework for our bank, our scotiabond, which establishes values and behaviours to drive high perf ormance and s upport the ex ecution of our strategy. scott thomson president and chief executive officer 2024 scotiabank annual report | 1
our success this year is not just about what we have delivered, but also how we have delivered. as a testament to the bank’s progress, scotiabank was once again named bank of the year for canada by the banker magazine — a financial times publication — as well as the top bank in canada by global finance and euromoney magazines. euromoney magazine also recognized scotiabank as the world’s best bank for corporate responsibility. i am extremely proud of our progress to date, of the strength of our team, and of all that we are achieving together. “as a testament to the bank’s progress, scotiabank was once again named bank of the year for canada by the banker magazine — a financial times publication — as well as the top bank in canada by global finance and euromoney magazines. euromoney magazine also recognized scotiabank as the world’s best bank for corporate responsibility.” scotiabond encompasses the core values and key behaviours needed to help us build a strong future for our clients, shareholders and scotiabankers globally. it’s our commitment to each other — to create safe spaces to learn and grow, to promote accountability and inclusivity, and to recognize we only win when we win together as one team. values a strong values-driven culture has always been part of the fabric of scotiabank. our values guide our day-to-day interactions and decisions, reflecting our client-centric focus in the way we do business across our f ootprint. behaviours our key behaviours outline the expectations of every scotiabanker to deliver on our strategic priorities and captures how we win together as one team. 2 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
grow and scale in priority markets at the core of our strategy is a focus on growing and scaling in our priority businesses across canada, the united states (u.s.), and mexico. as the only bank that operates at scale across the north american corridor, a unique differentiator for us, we are allocating the majority of our capital to focus our growth in north america. “as the only bank that operates at scale across the north american corridor, a unique differentiator for us, we are allocating the majority of our capital to focus our growth in north america.” in canada, we put greater emphasis this year on growing deposits across our portfolios, with retail deposits and investment growth up approximately 6% this year. while there is still much progress to be made, we have invested in transforming our business mix across different lines of business. we have strong momentum in our global wealth management business with year-over-year earnings growth of 10%, and fee and commissions revenue in our global banking and markets business is up approximately 14% this year. this increase is evidence of our growing emphasis on providing a more holistic suite of services to our clients, and the value that they see in our offering. in our international banking business, our countries are positioning to drive higher returns, with less capital deployed this year. less emphasis is being put on those areas with limited long-term strategic value to the bank, such as the agreement that we announced earlier this year to sell our consumer finance business in peru, while we grow our focus on those segments and client groups that drive a greater return. we are seeing the important role that all of our countries — even those outside of the north american corridor — are playing in growing and enhancing value for shareholders, while optimizing the capital already deployed in these businesses. consistent with our commitment to allocate more capital to north america, this year we announced an investment in keycorp, a large u.s. regional bank. the keycorp investment represents a cost-effective, high-return, and low-risk approach to deploying capital in the u.s. market, while contributing to near-term earnings growth. further to our goal to provide $350 billion in climate- related finance1 by 2030, we provided $40 billion this year and a total of $172 billion since november 1, 2018. “we are seeing the important role that all of our countries — even those outside of the north american corridor — are playing in growing and enhancing value for shareholders, while optimizing the capital already deployed in these businesses.” 1 climate-related finance consists of those products and services (such as lending and advisory services) as well as the types of transactions (such as sustainability-linked loans or dedicated purpose loans) which support, among other things, climate change mitigation, adaptation, pollution prevention, sustainable management of natural resources, biodiversity conservation and circular economy. for further details, see scotiabank’s climate-related finance framework. 2024 scotiabank annual report | 3
earn primary client relationships key to our execution is an increased focus on driving value over volume when it comes to our client relationships. we are putting greater emphasis on deeper, multi-product client relationships, rather than monoline lending-only relationships, and enhancing our value proposition for clients across all of our channels. we have already started to see some success this year, growing the number of primary clients across our canadian and international retail businesses by approximately 280,000. these are clients to whom we can provide core banking solutions, through ongoing delivery of our products and services, and who are engaged digitally. while good progress has been made in primary client growth, much more progress is needed to achieve our long-term aspirations. in our canadian retail business, our mortgage+ offering has driven strong growth in primary clients. through mortgage+, customers are able to unlock preferred mortgage rates as part of a product bundle, with more than 75% of new mortgages this year being mortgage+. through our scene+ program, we are continuing to expand our partnerships and deepen client relationships, including new product offerings introduced this year such as the scotia home hardware pro visa business card, designed to support entrepreneurs in the trades “this year, scene+ membership has grown to over 15 million clients, and almost 40% of scotiabank clients with scene+ have three or more scotiabank products.” and construction industry to better manage and expand their businesses. this year, scene+ membership has grown to over 15 million clients, and almost 40% of scotiabank clients with scene+ have three or more scotiabank products. for those digitally-savvy clients that prefer to transact almost entirely virtually, our tangerine bank continues to be the leading digital bank in canada. for the 13th c onsecutive year, tangerine bank topped the j.d. p ower 2024 canada retail banking satisfaction study, widening its lead amongst midsize banks in overall client satisfaction and building further gains in client trust and digital channels performance. we have also worked to enhance our cash management and global transaction banking capabilities, supporting our business clients’ day-to-day transaction, liquidity and working capital needs as we focus on building client primacy. our cash management platform, scotiaconnect, will elevate our offering in both mexico and canada, with our focus now on strengthening capabilities in the u.s. to make it easier for our multinational, corporate, and commercial clients to do business across the north american corridor. for our efforts in cash management, scotiabank was recognized as north america’s best cash management bank for corporate accounts and north america’s best cash management bank for foreign exchange in euromoney magazine’s 2024 cash management survey. 4 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
make it easy to do business with us the third pillar of our strategy is to make it easy to do business with us, by simplifying and improving access to our products and services and building an organization that is both more efficient and more effective. a core piece of this is our regionalization efforts. we are building scale and leveraging common platforms to enhance the client experience, drive greater client primacy, and work more effectively. particularly in our international banking business, this means moving from what was a federated model of countries, towards one that is more unified — in roles and responsibilities, in products, in processes and procedures, and in underlying architecture — so that clients can transact seamlessly across jurisdictions and in a common manner. we are already making good progress, generating positive operating leverage of 5% in international banking. similarly, in our canadian banking business, we have also made good progress, generating positive operating leverage of 2.6%. we are also investing in our core technology, having expanded our partnership with google cloud this year and naming it the enterprise cloud platform of choice for the next phase of our cloud acceleration journey. the partnership will enable us to further enhance both our client and employee experience, strengthen the security of the bank, and move faster on technologies that are shaping the future of business and society, such as generative ai. our partnership has already helped to create a more personal and predictive banking experience for our clients, including powering our award-winning chatbot. “we are building scale and leveraging common platforms to enhance the client experience, drive greater client primacy, and work more effectively.” 2024 scotiabank annual report | 5
3 win as one team finally, our fourth pillar is to win as one team, which reflects the important role that every scotiabanker has in driving our efforts forward. by breaking down silos and investing in our people, culture, and communities, we are working to create an environment where everyone can thrive and deliver their very best, each and every day. in this year’s internal employee sentiment survey, scotiabankers expressed a sense of belonging, and trust in senior leadership was up throughout the year, “by breaking down silos and investing in our people, culture, and communities, we are working to create an environment where everyone can thrive and deliver their very best, each and every day.” well exceeding the financial services benchmark. we were proud that scotiabank was once again recognized as one of the best workplaces™ in canada by great place to work® for the fifth consecutive year. one of the ways that we are demonstrating enterprise- wide thinking in action is the growing collaboration between our business lines to deliver for our customers. for example, in 2024 we had $13 billion in closed referrals across our canadian retail, commercial, and w ealth businesses — providing those clients with a mor e holistic suite of products and services that allow us to meet more of their financial services needs. continuing the strong progress we have made against our strategy requires cultivating a culture of high performance. building on our strong foundation, we introduced a new culture framework this year: scotiabond. comprised of core values and new behaviours, scotiabond is our commitment to each other — to create safe spaces to learn and grow, to promote accountability and inclusivity, and to recognize that we only win when awards and recognitions bank of the year 202 named bank of the year in canada for the fifth year in a row by the banker, as well as bank of the y ear in bahamas, barbados, cayman islands, and turks and caicos. scotiabank was recognized with 11 euromoney awards for excellence 2024, including the world’s best bank for corporate responsibility and best bank in canada, chile, the bahamas, jamaica, and trinidad and tobago. named north america’s best cash management bank for corporate accounts and north america’s best cash management bank for foreign exchange by euromoney. 6 | 2024 scotiabank annual report

outlook the bank expects solid earnings growth in 2025, benefitting from strong net interest income growth and higher net interest margin, driven by lower funding costs and growth in both loans and deposits. non-interest revenues are expected to grow more modestly. earnings are expected to be impacted by a higher tax rate, driven by the impact of global minimum taxes and reduction in inflation in certain international countries, and higher provision for credit losses. the bank expects moderate expense growth, as investments to strategically grow the bank will be partly offset by productivity initiatives. the bank is expected to generate positive operating leverage, and all capital and liquidity metrics are expected to remain strong in 2025."

improving experiences while streamlining and digitizing processes. last, win as one team by bringing the whole bank to our clients, while building and strengthening our culture where all employees can thrive. our strategy is underpinned by strong risk management practices to keep our bank and our clients safe, and a robust balance sheet that provides flexibility and growth opportunities across changing market conditions. economic summary the change in administration in the united states inserts some uncertainty into the global economic outlook. global central banks have begun a somewhat synchronized monetary easing as inflation approaches target rates in a large number of countries. this easing should support economic activity in coming years leading to gradual strengthening of the global economy. the results of the u.s. election raises some questions on the path forward for global growth and inflation that depend largely on the president-elect’s approach to trade and immigration policy and the uncertainty this may create. in the short-run, proposed cuts to corporate tax rates are likely to support growth, as will efforts to ease the regulatory burden in some sectors of the economy. the imposition of broad-based tariffs would raise input costs for firms, putting upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on economic activity. aggressive trade policies could raise the risk of retaliation from impacted countries, raising global inflation while reducing growth. in canada, the cuts in the bank of canada’s policy rate should lead to a rebound in economic activity next year, from the roughly 1.2% expected in 2024 to around 2% next year. the interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy, notably consumption and the housing sector, should underpin this modest recovery and there is already evidence of this occurring. with inflation largely under control, the bank of canada is forecast to lower interest rates until late spring, for a total cut of 200 basis points from peak policy rate to the 3% terminal value. further policy rate cuts are also expected in the u.s., though the economy there is substantially stronger than in other advanced economies. the past tightening in monetary policy should contribute to moderate growth next year, as the economy is expected to slow from a roughly 2.6% pace this year to around 1.8% in 2025. the u.s. outlook is subject to considerable policy uncertainty, which suggests the economy could be stronger than expected early next year, but then weaken somewhat if uncertainty remains high and changes in trade and immigration policies are implemented. progress on the inflation front should allow the federal reserve to continue cutting interest rates until mid-2025. central banks in the latin american countries are also in the process of normalizing interest rates, with further reductions in policy rates expected across the region. the impact of past interest rate increases continue to be felt across the region. as a consequence, growth is expected to moderate from the 2024 pace across most countries. economic prospects are perhaps most challenging in mexico, where the economic impacts of the judicial reform and other changes are yet to be fully understood. the incoming u.s. administration risks posing additional, though not currently quantifiable, headwinds for the mexican economy. 28 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
outlook the bank expects solid earnings growth in 2025, benefitting from strong net interest income growth and higher net interest margin, driven by lower funding costs and growth in both loans and deposits. non-interest revenues are expected to grow more modestly. earnings are expected to be impacted by a higher tax rate, driven by the impact of global minimum taxes and reduction in inflation in certain international countries, and higher provision for credit losses. the bank expects moderate expense growth, as investments to strategically grow the bank will be partly offset by productivity initiatives. the bank is expected to generate positive operating leverage, and all capital and liquidity metrics are expected to remain strong in 2025. impact of foreign currency translation the impact of foreign currency translation on net income is shown in the table below. t10 impact of foreign currency translation for the fiscal years 2024 2023 average exchange rate % change average exchange rate % change u.s. dollar/canadian dollar 0.735 (0.9)% 0.742 (4.5)% mexican peso/canadian dollar 13.091 (2.5)% 13.424 (15.0)% peruvian sol/canadian dollar 2.757 (1.1)% 2.788 (7.1)% colombian peso/canadian dollar 2,943.081 (11.1)% 3,309.943 3.9% chilean peso/canadian dollar 682.082 9.2% 624.816 (6.7)% impact on net income(1) ($ millions except eps) 2024 vs. 2023 2023 vs. 2022 net interest income $ (31) $ 665 non-interest income(2) 243 60 non-interest expenses (70) (517) other items (net of tax)(2) (56) (158) net income $ 86 $ 50 earnings per share (diluted) $ 0.07 $ 0.04 impact by business line ($ millions) canadian banking $ 2 $ 3 international banking(2) 90 71 global wealth management – 23 global banking and markets 5 62 other(2) (11) (109) $ 86 $ 50 (1) includes impact of all currencies.

group financial performance net income net income was $7,892 million in 2024 compared to $7,450 million in 2023, an increase of 6%. the increase was driven mainly by higher revenues and lower provision for income taxes, partly offset by higher provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses. adjusted net income was $8,627 million compared to $8,363 million, an increase of 3%. the increase was driven mainly by higher revenues, partly offset by higher provision for credit losses, non-interest expenses and provision for income taxes. refer to non-gaap measures starting on page 20 for further details on adjusting items. net interest income net interest income was $19,252 million, an increase of $990 million or 5% due primarily to a higher net interest margin and asset growth. higher net interest income in canadian banking and international banking was partly offset by lower net interest income in the other segment due mainly to higher funding costs and higher losses from hedges, partly offset by higher income from liquid assets. the net interest margin was 2.16%, an increase of four basis points, driven primarily by higher margins in canadian banking and international banking. this was partly offset by a lower contribution from asset/liability management activities, including increased levels of high quality, lower yielding liquid assets. t11 average balance sheet(1) and net interest income for the fiscal years ($ billions) 2024 2023 average balance(2) interest average rate average balance(2) interest average rate assets $ 64.5 $ 3.1 4.79% $ 77.6 $ 3.5 4.47%deposits with financial institutions trading assets 146.3 1.7 1.13% 121.7 1.8 1.52% securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed 193.1 1.6 0.83% 187.9 1.5 0.79% investment securities 147.6 7.5 5.09% 117.5 5.0 4.25% loans: residential mortgages 343.6 16.0 4.67% 349.6 15.3 4.37% personal loans 105.5 8.8 8.32% 102.9 7.9 7.68% credit cards 17.3 3.2 18.53% 16.0 2.9 18.42% business and government 289.9 19.8 6.82% 293.4 18.9 6.45% allowance for credit losses (6.6) (5.8) total loans $ 749.7 $ 47.8 6.38% $ 756.1 $ 45.0 5.96% customers’ liability under acceptances 10.0 20.9 total average earning assets(3) $1,311.2 $ 61.7 4.70% $1,281.7 $ 56.8 4.43% other assets 108.1 114.4 total average assets $1,419.3 $ 61.7 4.34% $1,396.1 $ 56.8 4.07% liabilities and equity deposits: personal $ 292.4 $ 9.5 3.25% $ 279.2 $ 7.7 2.76% business and government 610.2 28.2 4.63% 621.3 26.2 4.22% financial institutions 49.1 1.8 3.58% 55.3 1.7 3.06% total deposits $ 951.7 $ 39.5 4.15% $ 955.8 $ 35.6 3.73% obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities lent 176.2 0.7 0.40% 141.5 0.7 0.51% subordinated debentures 8.5 0.5 5.74% 9.4 0.5 5.01% other interest-bearing liabilities 73.0 1.7 2.37% 79.5 1.7 2.16% total interest-bearing liabilities $1,209.4 $ 42.4 3.51% $1,186.2 $ 38.5 3.25% financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss 33.5 25.7 other liabilities including acceptances 94.9 107.1 equity(4) 81.5 77.1 total liabilities and equity $1,419.3 $ 42.4 2.99% $1,396.1 $ 38.5 2.76% net interest income $ 19.3 $ 18.3 management’s discussion and analysis (1) average of daily balances.

group financial performance net income net income was $7,892 million in 2024 compared to $7,450 million in 2023, an increase of 6%. the increase was driven mainly by higher revenues and lower provision for income taxes, partly offset by higher provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses. adjusted net income was $8,627 million compared to $8,363 million, an increase of 3%. the increase was driven mainly by higher revenues, partly offset by higher provision for credit losses, non-interest expenses and provision for income taxes. refer to non-gaap measures starting on page 20 for further details on adjusting items. net interest income net interest income was $19,252 million, an increase of $990 million or 5% due primarily to a higher net interest margin and asset growth. higher net interest income in canadian banking and international banking was partly offset by lower net interest income in the other segment due mainly to higher funding costs and higher losses from hedges, partly offset by higher income from liquid assets. the net interest margin was 2.16%, an increase of four basis points, driven primarily by higher margins in canadian banking and international banking. this was partly offset by a lower contribution from asset/liability management activities, including increased levels of high quality, lower yielding liquid assets. t11 average balance sheet(1) and net interest income for the fiscal years ($ billions) 2024 2023 average balance(2) interest average rate average balance(2) interest average rate assets $ 64.5 $ 3.1 4.79% $ 77.6 $ 3.5 4.47%deposits with financial institutions trading assets 146.3 1.7 1.13% 121.7 1.8 1.52% securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed 193.1 1.6 0.83% 187.9 1.5 0.79% investment securities 147.6 7.5 5.09% 117.5 5.0 4.25% loans: residential mortgages 343.6 16.0 4.67% 349.6 15.3 4.37% personal loans 105.5 8.8 8.32% 102.9 7.9 7.68% credit cards 17.3 3.2 18.53% 16.0 2.9 18.42% business and government 289.9 19.8 6.82% 293.4 18.9 6.45% allowance for credit losses (6.6) (5.8) total loans $ 749.7 $ 47.8 6.38% $ 756.1 $ 45.0 5.96% customers’ liability under acceptances 10.0 20.9 total average earning assets(3) $1,311.2 $ 61.7 4.70% $1,281.7 $ 56.8 4.43% other assets 108.1 114.4 total average assets $1,419.3 $ 61.7 4.34% $1,396.1 $ 56.8 4.07% liabilities and equity deposits: personal $ 292.4 $ 9.5 3.25% $ 279.2 $ 7.7 2.76% business and government 610.2 28.2 4.63% 621.3 26.2 4.22% financial institutions 49.1 1.8 3.58% 55.3 1.7 3.06% total deposits $ 951.7 $ 39.5 4.15% $ 955.8 $ 35.6 3.73% obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities lent 176.2 0.7 0.40% 141.5 0.7 0.51% subordinated debentures 8.5 0.5 5.74% 9.4 0.5 5.01% other interest-bearing liabilities 73.0 1.7 2.37% 79.5 1.7 2.16% total interest-bearing liabilities $1,209.4 $ 42.4 3.51% $1,186.2 $ 38.5 3.25% financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss 33.5 25.7 other liabilities including acceptances 94.9 107.1 equity(4) 81.5 77.1 total liabilities and equity $1,419.3 $ 42.4 2.99% $1,396.1 $ 38.5 2.76% net interest income $ 19.3 $ 18.3 management’s discussion and analysis (1) average of daily balances.

management’s discussion and analysis governance and oversight the bank has a sound capital management framework to measure, deploy and monitor its available capital and assess its adequacy. capital is managed in accordance with the board-approved capital management policy. in addition, the board reviews and approves the bank’s annual capital and strategic plans. the asset-liability committee and senior executive management provide governance over the capital management process. the bank’s finance, group treasury and global risk management groups take a coordinated approach to implementing the bank’s capital plan. risk appetite the risk appetite framework that establishes enterprise-wide risk tolerances in addition to capital limits is detailed in the risk management section “risk appetite”. the framework encompasses medium-term targets with respect to regulatory capital thresholds, earnings and other risk-based parameters. these limits drive behaviour to ensure the bank achieves the following overall objectives: exceed regulatory and internal capital targets, manage capital levels commensurate with the risk profile of the bank, maintain strong credit ratings and provide the bank’s shareholders with acceptable returns. regulatory capital canadian banks are subject to the revised capital adequacy requirements as published by the basel committee on banking supervision (bcbs) and commonly referred to as basel iii. under basel iii, there are three primary risk-based regulatory capital ratios used to assess capital adequacy: common equity tier 1 (cet1), tier 1 and total capital, which are determined by dividing those capital components by risk-weighted assets. basel iii also provides guidance on non-viability contingent capital (nvcc). the guidance stipulates that in order to qualify as regulatory capital, non-common share capital instruments must be convertible into common equity upon a trigger event as defined within the guidance."
58,60,"the office of the superintendent of financial institutions, canada (osfi)",c23 continuity of common equity tier 1 ratio (1),group_finnacial_condition,"the office of the superintendent of financial institutions, canada (osfi) has issued guidelines, reporting requirements and disclosure guidance which are consistent with the international implementation of basel iii. osfi requires canadian deposit-taking institutions to meet minimum requirements related to risk-weighted assets of 7%, 8.5% and 10.5% for cet1, tier 1 and total capital ratios, respectively, which includes the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. osfi has also designated the bank a domestic systemically important bank (d-sib), increasing its minimum capital ratio requirements by 1% across all tiers of capital, in line with the requirements for global systemically important banks. osfi’s minimum pillar 1 capital ratio requirements, are 8.0%, 9.5% and 11.5% for common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total capital ratios, respectively. in june 2018, osfi implemented the domestic stability buffer, to be held by domestic systemically important banks (d-sibs) as an additional pillar 2 buffer. breaches of this buffer will not result in banks being subject to automatic constraints on capital distributions. instead, osfi will require a remediation plan to address any shortfall to their minimum. supervisory interventions pursuant to osfi’s guide to intervention would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not produced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to osfi. osfi undertakes a review of the buffer on a semi-annual basis, in june and december, and any changes to the buffer are made public, along with supporting rationale. in exceptional circumstances, osfi may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in-between scheduled review dates. in addition, osfi may subsequently vary the minimum requirements for individual d-sibs or groups of d-sibs, as a supervisory measure. in june 2023, osfi announced that the domestic stability buffer (dsb) will increase to 3.5% of total risk-weighted assets (rwa), effective november 1, 2023. in addition, in june 2024, osfi maintained the dsb at 3.5% of rwa. osfi’s minimum regulatory capital ratio requirements, including the d-sib 1.0% surcharge and its dsb are: 11.5%, 13.0% and 15.0% for common equity tier 1 (cet1), tier 1 and total capital ratios, respectively. leverage ratio in addition to risk-based capital ratio requirements, basel iii introduced a simpler, non risk-based leverage ratio requirement to act as a supplementary measure to its risk-based capital requirements. the leverage ratio is defined as a ratio of basel iii tier 1 capital to a leverage exposure measure which includes on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet commitments, derivatives and securities financing transactions, as defined within the requirements. osfi’s basel iii leverage ratio requirements guideline and public disclosure requirements outline the application and disclosure of the basel iii leverage ratio in canada. institutions are expected to maintain an operating buffer above the 3.5% minimum, including the d-sib surcharge of 0.5%, effective q2 2023. total loss absorbing capacity (tlac) osfi has issued its guideline on total loss absorbing capacity (tlac), which applies to canada’s d-sibs as part of the federal government’s bail-in regime. the standard is intended to address the sufficiency of a systemically important bank’s loss absorbing capacity to support its 56 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
recapitalization in the event of its failure. d-sibs are required to maintain a minimum risk-based total loss absorbing capacity (tlac) ratio and a minimum tlac leverage ratio. tlac is defined as the aggregate of nvcc tier 1 capital, nvcc tier 2 capital, and other tlac instruments that are subject to conversion in whole or in part into common shares under the canada deposit insurance corporation (cdic) act and meet all of the eligibility criteria under the guidelines. the bank’s minimum tlac ratio requirements consist of 25.0% of rwa and 7.25% of leverage ratio exposures. as noted above, osfi may subsequently vary the minimum tlac requirements for d-sibs. where a d-sib falls below the minimum tlac requirements, osfi may take any measures deemed appropriate, including measures set out in the bank act (canada). as at october 31, 2024, the bank exceeds the osfi minimum tlac and tlac leverage ratios. regulatory capital developments effective the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the bank adopted the revised basel iii reforms in accordance with osfi’s revised capital adequacy requirements guideline, leverage ratio requirements guideline, and pillar 3 disclosures guideline for domestic systematically important banks (d-sibs). osfi’s requirements are substantially aligned with the bcbs’ revised basel iii reforms with some differences, primarily in residential real estate and qualifying revolving retail exposures, and with respect to an acceleration of the phase-in period of the aggregate capital output floor to 72.5% by 2026. revised basel iii reforms the final basel iii reforms implemented in the second quarter of 2023 primarily impact the calculation of rwa and include: • a revised standardized approach for credit risk, with increased granularity of prescribed risk weights for credit cards, mortgages and business loans; • revisions to the internal ratings-based approach for credit risk with new requirements for internally developed model parameters under the advanced internal ratings-based approach (airb), including scope restrictions which limit certain asset classes to only the foundation internal ratings-based (firb) approach; • a revised standardized approach for operational risk, which builds on the existing standardized approach including the recognition of an institution’s operational risk loss experience; • revisions to the measurement of the leverage ratio and a leverage ratio buffer, which will take the form of a tier 1 capital buffer set at 50% of a d-sib’s 1.0% risk-weighted surcharge capital buffer; and, • an aggregate output floor, which will ensure that banks’ rwas generated by internal models are not lower than 72.5% of rwas as calculated by the basel iii framework’s standardized approaches. there is an international phase-in period for the 72.5% aggregate capital output floor from 2023 until 2028, beginning at 65% for canadian banks in the second quarter of 2023. internationally, adoption of the revised basel iii reforms is varied across jurisdictions. current expectations are that many jurisdictions will implement no earlier than 2025. additionally, the revised market risk framework and credit valuation adjustment (cva) framework were implemented in the first quarter of 2024. the main changes include: • revised standardized and modelled approaches for market risk capital requirements. • a new standardized approach for cva (sa-cva) similar to the standardized approach for market risk. internationally, adoption of the revised basel iii reforms is varied across jurisdictions. current expectations are that many jurisdictions will implement no earlier than 2025. the bank continues to monitor and prepare for developments impacting regulatory capital requirements. osfi delays phase-in of basel iii output floor in july 2024, osfi announced a one-year delay to the increase of the capital output floor. osfi has noted that the one-year delay will give osfi time to consider the implementation timeline of the basel iii 2017 reforms in other jurisdictions. as noted above, canada concluded its implementation of the revised basel iii 2017 reforms in early 2024 and established an accelerated phase-in of the capital output floor, calibrated at 65% in 2023, increasing in the first quarter by 2.5% per year through to 72.5% in 2026. osfi’s announcement of a one-year delay maintains the capital floor calibration at 67.5% through fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, increasing to 70% in 2026 and 72.5% in 2027. osfi plans to continue to measure implementation progress of the basel iii 2017 reforms across jurisdictions with a focus on both the competitive balance in banking and the soundness of canada’s capital regime. osfi finalizes its solo total loss absorbing capacity (tlac) framework in september 2023, osfi finalized changes to its solo tlac framework, effective the first quarter of 2024. under this framework, osfi has established a risk-based solo tlac ratio, which builds on the risk-based tlac ratio set out in osfi’s tlac guideline and the risk-based capital ratios described within osfi’s capital adequacy requirements guideline. the risk-based solo tlac ratio will be the primary basis used by osfi to assess the sufficiency of tlac that is readily available to the domestic parent bank and to assess the parent’s ability to act as a source of strength for its subsidiaries and/or other affiliates. d-sibs are required to maintain a minimum solo tlac ratio of 21.5% on a continuous basis. public disclosure of a d-sibs’ solo tlac ratio is not presently a requirement. osfi plans to consult on its data assurance and its future public disclosure expectations in due course. the bank is compliant with osfi’s final solo tlac requirements. the bank continues to monitor and prepare for developments impacting regulatory capital requirements. planning, managing and monitoring capital capital is managed and monitored based on planned changes in the bank’s strategy, identified changes in its operating environment or changes in its risk profile. as part of the bank’s comprehensive icaap, sources and uses of capital are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through financial metrics, including regulatory thresholds, and internal capital. these results are used in capital planning and strategic decision-making. the bank’s assessment of capital adequacy is in the context of its current position and its expected future risk profile and position relative to its internal targets while considering the potential impact of various stress scenarios. specific scenarios are selected based on the current economic conditions and business events facing the bank. in addition, the bank’s forward looking capital adequacy assessment includes a consideration of the results of more severe multi-risk scenarios within its enterprise-wide stress testing. this testing is used to determine the extent to which severe, but plausible events, impact the bank’s capital. the bank sets internal regulatory capital targets to ensure the bank’s available capital is sufficient within the context of its risk appetite. management’s discussion and analysis | group financial condition 2024 scotiabank annual report | 57
management’s discussion and analysis the bank’s internal target includes an adequate buffer over the regulatory minimum ensuring sufficient flexibility for future capital deployment and in consideration of the bank’s risk appetite, the volatility of planning assumptions, the results from stress testing and contingency planning. the bank has a comprehensive risk management framework to ensure that the risks taken while conducting its business activities are consistent with its risk appetite, its impact on capital relative to internal targets, and that there is an appropriate balance between risk and return. refer to the risk management section for further discussion on the bank’s risk management framework. in managing the bank’s capital base, close attention is paid to the cost and availability of the various types of capital, desired leverage, changes in the assets and risk-weighted assets, and the opportunities to profitably deploy capital. the amount of capital required for the business risks being assumed, and to meet regulatory requirements, is balanced against the goal of generating an appropriate return for the bank’s shareholders. capital generation capital is generated internally through net earnings after dividend payments. as well, capital is generated by the issuance of common shares, preferred shares and other equity instruments, and subordinated debentures, net of redemptions. capital deployment the bank deploys capital to support sustainable, long-term revenue and net income growth. the growth can be through existing businesses by attracting new customers, increasing cross-selling activities to existing customers, adding new products and enhancing sales productivity, or through acquisitions. all major initiatives to deploy capital are subject to rigorous analysis, validation of business case assumptions and evaluation of expected benefits. key financial criteria include impact on earnings per share, capital ratios, return on invested capital, expected payback period and internal rate of return based on discounted cash flows. regulatory capital and total loss absorbing capacity ratios the bank continues to maintain strong, high quality capital levels which position it well for future business growth and opportunities. the cet1 ratio as at october 31, 2024 was 13.1 %, an increase of approximately 10 basis points from the prior year. the ratio benefited from internal capital generation, share issuances under the bank’s shareholder dividend and share purchase plan, and revaluation gains on fvoci securities, partly offset by the adoption impacts from the revised basel iii frtb market and cva capital requirements, rwa growth and the bank’s initial investment in keycorp. the bank’s tier 1 capital ratio was 15.0% as at october 31, 2024, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from the prior year, due primarily to the above noted impacts to the cet1 ratio and a u.s. $750 million issuance of limited recourse capital notes partly offset by a redemption of $300 million of preferred shares. the bank’s total capital ratio was 16.7% as at october 31, 2024, a decrease of approximately 50 basis points from 2023, due primarily to redemptions of $3.25 billion of subordinated debentures, partly offset by the issuance of $1 billion of subordinated debentures and the above noted impacts to the tier 1 capital ratio. the tlac ratio was 29.7% as at october 31, 2024, a decrease of approximately 90 basis points from the prior year, primarily from higher rwa. the leverage ratio was 4.4% as at october 31, 2024, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year, due primarily to growth in tier 1 capital. the tlac leverage ratio was 8.8%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from 2023, due primarily to higher available tlac. the bank’s capital, leverage and tlac ratios continue to be in excess of osfi’s minimum capital ratio requirements for 2024. in 2025, the bank will continue to maintain strong capital ratios, continuing to optimize capital deployment in line with its strategic plans while absorbing the impact of the bank’s increased investment in keycorp."
63,63,regulatory capital components the bank’s regulatory capital is divided into three components,t31 selected capital management activity,group_finnacial_condition,"regulatory capital components the bank’s regulatory capital is divided into three components – cet1, additional tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital, depending on their degree of permanency and loss absorbency. all components of capital provide support for banking operations and protect depositors. cet1 consists primarily of common shareholders’ equity, regulatory derived non-controlling interest capital, and prescribed regulatory adjustments or deductions. these regulatory deductions include goodwill, intangible assets (net of deferred tax liabilities), deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability, defined-benefit pension assets and the shortfall (if any) of the allowance for credit losses to regulatory parameter-based expected losses. additional tier 1 capital consists primarily of qualifying non-cumulative preferred shares, and qualifying other equity instruments (as described in note 25). tier 2 capital consists mainly of qualifying subordinated debentures and eligible allowances for credit losses. the bank’s cet1 capital was $60.6 billion as at october 31, 2024, an increase of approximately $3.6 billion from the prior year due primarily to: • $2.1 billion growth from internal capital generation, net of dividends paid; • $1.9 billion from share issuances, mainly from the bank’s shareholder dividend and share purchase plan; • $0.7 billion from changes in the regulatory deduction for own credit risk on fair valued liabilities; and, • $0.4 billion from lower regulatory deductions and other regulatory adjustments. partly offset by: • $1.6 billion decrease from movements in accumulated other comprehensive income, excluding cash flow hedges, primarily from the impact of foreign currency translation, net of changes in the fair values of investment securities. the bank’s tier 1 capital increased by $4.3 billion to $69.5 billion, primarily due to the above noted impacts to cet1 capital and a usd $750 million issuance of limited recourse capital notes partly offset by a redemption of $300 million of preferred shares. total capital increased by $2.1 billion during the year to $77.7 billion, mainly due to the above noted impacts to cet1 and tier 1 capital, and the issuance of $1 billion of subordinated debentures, partly offset by redemptions of $3.25 billion of subordinated debentures. c24 cet1 capital %, as at october 31 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 23 24 dividends the annual dividend in 2024 was $4.24, an increase of $0.06 from 2023. the board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.06 per common share, at its meeting on december 2, 2024. this quarterly dividend applies to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 7, 2025, and is payable january 29, 2025."

65,65,credit ratings credit ratings are one of the factors that impact the,t33 flow statement for basel iii credit risk-weighted assets ($ millions),group_finnacial_condition,"credit ratings credit ratings are one of the factors that impact the bank’s access to capital markets and the terms on which it can conduct derivatives, hedging transactions and borrow funds. the credit ratings and outlook that the rating agencies assign to the bank are based on their own views and methodologies. the bank continues to have strong credit ratings and its deposits and legacy senior debt are rated aa by fitch ratings, aa2 by moody’s, aa by morningstar dbrs and a+ by standard and poor’s (s&p). the bank’s bail-inable senior debt is rated aa- by fitch ratings, a2 by moody’s, aa (low) by morningstar dbrs, and a- by s&p. as of october 31, 2024, all such rating agencies have a stable outlook on the bank. credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, sell or hold a security and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency. risk-weighted assets regulatory capital requirements are based on osfi’s target minimum percentage of risk-weighted assets (rwa). rwa represent the bank’s exposure to credit, market and operational risks and are computed by applying a combination of the osfi approved bank’s internal risk models and osfi prescribed risk weights to on and off-balance sheet exposures. in addition, osfi has adopted the revised basel iii aggregate output floor, which ensures that the bank’s total rwa are not lower than 72.5% of rwa as calculated by the revised basel iii framework’s standardized approaches. the output floor has been set at 72.5% with an international phase-in period from 2023 to 2028. for canadian banks, the floor is presently at 67.5%. as noted above, osfi has delayed further increases to the floor to 2026 (70%) and 2027 (72.5%). as at year end, the bank’s rwa of $464.0 billion, represents an increase of approximately $24.0 billion, or 5.5%, from 2023, due primarily to the adoption impacts from the revised basel iii frtb market and cva capital requirements, higher rwa from changes in book quality, model updates, and the bank’s initial investment in keycorp, partly offset by lower volumes from capital optimization initiatives and the impacts from foreign currency translation. credit risk-weighted assets credit risk measures the risk that a borrower or counterparty will fail to honour its financial or contractual obligations to the bank. the credit risk component consists of on and off-balance sheet claims. the basel iii rules are not applied to traditional balance sheet categories but to categories of on and off-balance sheet exposures which represent general classes of assets or exposure types (e.g. large corporate, mid-size corporate, small and medium enterprise, sovereign, bank, retail mortgages, other retail, equity, etc.) based on their different underlying risk characteristics. generally, while calculating capital requirements, exposure types are analyzed by the following credit risk exposure sub-types: drawn, undrawn, repo-style transactions, over-the-counter (otc) derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives and other off-balance sheet claims. credit risk-weighted assets increased by $19.5 billion to $398.2 billion. the key drivers or components of the change are reflected in table t33 below."
66,67,credit risk-weighted assets – non-retail the bank uses the internal ratings based (irb) approach under revised basel iii,t36 portfolio-level comparison of estimated and actual non-retail percentages,group_finnacial_condition,"credit risk-weighted assets – non-retail the bank uses the internal ratings based (irb) approach under revised basel iii to determine minimum regulatory capital requirements for credit risk in its canadian, u.s. and european credit portfolios, and for a significant portion of its international corporate and commercial portfolios. the remaining credit portfolios are subject to the standardized approach, which relies on the external credit ratings (e.g. s&p, morningstar dbrs, fitch, etc.) of borrowers, if available, or prescribed risk weights for real estate lending to compute regulatory capital for credit risk. for the bank’s corporate, bank and sovereign irb portfolios, the key risk measures used in the quantification of regulatory capital for credit risk include probability of default (pd), loss given default (lgd) and exposure at default (ead). • probability of default (pd) measures the likelihood that a borrower, with an assigned internal grade (ig) rating, will default within a one-year time horizon. ig ratings are a component of the bank’s risk rating system. each of the bank’s internal borrower ig ratings is mapped to a pd estimate. 64 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
• loss given default (lgd) measures the severity of loss on a facility in the event of a borrower’s default. lgd segments are determined based on facility characteristics such as seniority, collateral type, collateral coverage and other structural elements. each lgd segment is assigned a lgd estimate. lgd is based on the concept of economic loss and is calculated using the present value of repayments, recoveries and related direct and indirect expenses. • exposure at default (ead) measures the expected exposure on a facility at the time of default. under the advanced internal ratings based (airb) approach, all three risk measures are estimated using the bank’s historical data, as well as available external benchmarks, and are updated on a regular basis. the historical data used for estimating these risk measures exceeds the minimum five-year airb requirement for pd estimates and the minimum seven-year airb requirement for lgd and ead estimates. under revised basel iii there are new irb requirements for internally developed model parameters under airb including scope restrictions which limit certain asset classes to only the foundation internal ratings based (firb) approach. for those asset classes (e.g. large corporates, banks, etc.) the firb utilizes the bank’s internally modeled pd parameters combined with internationally prescribed lgd and ead parameters. further adjustments, as required under the basel iii framework and osfi’s requirements set out in its domestic implementation notes, including any input floor requirements, are applied to average estimates obtained from historical data. these adjustments incorporate the regulatory requirements pertaining to: • long-run estimation of pd, which requires that pd estimates capture average default experience over a reasonable mix of high-default and low-default years of the economic cycle; • downturn estimation for internally modeled airb lgd, which requires that lgd estimates appropriately reflect conditions observed during periods where credit losses are substantially higher than average; • downturn estimation for internally modeled airb ead, which requires that ead estimates appropriately reflect conditions observed during periods of economic downturn; and • the addition of a margin of conservatism, which is related to the likely range of errors based on the identification and quantification of the various sources of uncertainty inherent in historical estimates. these risk measures are used in the calculation of regulatory capital requirements based on the basel framework. the credit quality distribution of the bank’s irb non-retail portfolio is shown in table t35. portfolio average pd, lgd and rw increased marginally year-over-year due to changes in customer ratings and model updates. the risk measures are subject to a rigorous back-testing framework which uses the bank’s historical data to ensure that they are appropriately calibrated. based on results obtained from the back-testing process, risk measures are reviewed, re-calibrated and independently validated on at least an annual basis in order to reflect the implications of new data, technical advances and other relevant information. • as pd estimates represent long-run parameters, back-testing is performed using historical data spanning at least one full economic cycle. realized pds are back-tested using pre-defined confidence intervals, and the results are then aggregated to provide an overall assessment of the appropriateness of each pd estimate; • the back-testing for airb lgd and ead estimates is conducted from both long-run and downturn perspectives, in order to ensure that these estimates are adequately conservative to reflect both long-run and downturn conditions. portfolio-level back-testing results, based on a comparison of estimated and realized parameters for the four-quarter period ended at july 31, 2024, are shown in table t36. during this period the actual experiences of pd, lgd and ccf were materially lower than the estimates as reflected within the risk parameters."

management’s discussion and analysis • lgd is adjusted to appropriately reflect economic downturn conditions. • ead may also be adjusted to reflect downturn conditions when pd and ead are highly correlated. • sources of uncertainty are reviewed regularly to ensure uncertainties are identified, quantified and included in calculations so that all parameter estimates reflect appropriate levels of conservatism. the table below summarizes the credit quality distribution of the bank’s airb retail portfolio as at october 31, 2024. year-over-year the bank’s airb retail portfolio parameters and average risk weights at the total portfolio level remained stable."

and • structured finance entities. the bank earned total fees of $73 million in 2024 (october 31, 2023 – $51 million) from certain structured entities in which it had a significant interest at the end of the year but did not consolidate. more information with respect to the bank’s involvement with these unconsolidated structured entities, including details of liquidity facilities and maximum loss exposure by category is provided below and in note 16(b) to the consolidated financial statements. canadian multi-seller conduits administered by the bank the bank sponsors two canadian-based multi-seller conduits that are not consolidated. the bank earned commercial paper issuance fees, program management fees, liquidity fees and other fees from these multi-seller conduits, which totaled $54 million in 2024, compared to $47 million in 2023. these multi-seller conduits purchase high-quality financial assets and finance these assets through the issuance of highly-rated commercial paper. as further described below, the bank’s exposure to these off-balance sheet conduits primarily consists of liquidity support and temporary holdings of commercial paper. although the bank has power over the relevant activities of the conduits, it has limited exposure to variability in returns, which results in the bank not consolidating the two canadian conduits. the bank has a process to monitor these exposures and significant events impacting the conduits to ensure there is no change in control, which could require the bank to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the conduits at fair value. a significant portion of the conduits’ assets have been structured to receive credit enhancements from the sellers, including overcollateralization protection and cash reserve accounts. each asset purchased by the conduits is supported by a backstop liquidity facility provided by the bank in the form of a liquidity asset purchase agreement (lapa). the primary purpose of the backstop liquidity facility is to provide an alternative source of financing in the event the conduits are unable to access the commercial paper market. under the terms of the lapa, in most cases, the bank is not obliged to purchase defaulted assets. the bank’s primary exposure to the canadian-based conduits is the liquidity support provided, with total liquidity facilities of $7.7 billion as at october 31, 2024 (october 31, 2023 – $7.1 billion). the year-over-year increase was due to normal business operations. as at october 31, 2024, total commercial paper outstanding for the canadian-based conduits was $6.4 billion (october 31, 2023 – $5.4 billion) and the bank held 0.1% (october 31, 2023 – 0.2%) of the total commercial paper issued by these conduits. table t41 presents a summary of assets purchased and held by the bank’s two canadian multi-seller conduits as at october 31, 2024 and 2023, by underlying exposure. all of the funded assets have at least an equivalent rating of aa or higher based on the bank’s internal rating program; and assets held in these conduits were investment grade as at october 31, 2024 and 2023. 68 | 2024 scotiabank annual report"

financing through their securitization structures. the bank’s maximum exposure to loss from structured finance entities was $11,469 million as at october 31, 2024 (october 31, 2023 – $3,296 million). the year-over-year increase was due to normal business operations and new transactions. the bank provides senior credit facilities to unaffiliated structured entities that are established by third parties to acquire and/or originate loans for the purposes of issuing collateralized loan obligations (clos). these credit facilities benefit from subordinated capital provided by either the collateral manager or third-party investors via subordinated financing, capital injection or asset contribution. subordinated capital represents the first loss tranche which absorbs losses prior to the bank’s senior exposure. the bank’s broker-dealer affiliate acts as the arranger and placement agent for the clos. proceeds from the sale of the clos are used to repay the senior credit facilities. the bank does not consolidate these entities as it does not have decision making power over their relevant activities, which include the acquisition and/or origination of loans and overall management of the underlying portfolio. the bank’s maximum exposure to loss was $9,743 million as at october 31, 2024 (october 31, 2023 – $1,511 million), relating to credit facilities extended to these entities, of which $4,243 million was funded (october 31, 2023 – $220 million). the increase in the bank’s maximum exposure to loss during the year was driven by the addition of new financing facilities. other funding vehicles these entities are designed to pass the bank’s credit risk to the holders of the securities. therefore, the bank does not have exposure or rights to variable returns from these unconsolidated entities. the bank uses a funding vehicle to transfer credit exposure on certain loan assets and purchases credit protection against eligible credit events from this vehicle. the vehicle collateralizes its obligation using cash proceeds received through the issuance of guarantee-linked notes. loan assets are not sold or assigned to the vehicle and remain on the bank’s consolidated statement of financial position. the total principal balance of guarantee-linked notes issued by this vehicle and outstanding was $1,002 million as at october 31, 2024 (october 31, 2023 – $998 million). these are included in deposits – business and government on the bank’s consolidated statement of financial position. other unconsolidated structured entities the bank sponsors unconsolidated structured entities including mutual funds, in which it has insignificant or no interest at the reporting date. the bank is a sponsor when it is significantly involved in the design and formation at inception of the structured entity, and the bank’s name is used by the structured entity to create an awareness of the instruments being backed by the bank’s reputation and obligation. the bank also considers other factors, such as its continuing involvement and obligations to determine if, in substance, the bank is a sponsor. for the year ended october 31, 2024, the bank earned $2,547 million income from its involvement with the unconsolidated bank-sponsored structured entities, all of which is from bank-sponsored mutual funds (for the year ended october 31, 2023 – $2,369 million). securitizations the bank securitizes fully insured residential mortgage loans, originated by the bank and third parties, through the creation of mortgage-backed securities that are sold to canada housing trust (cht), canada mortgage and housing corporation (cmhc) or third-party investors, as an efficient source of financing. the sale of such mortgages does not meet the derecognition requirements where the bank retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the securitized mortgages. the transferred mortgages continue to be recognized on the consolidated statement of financial position, along with the proceeds from sale treated as secured borrowings. more details have been provided in note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. third-party originated mortgages purchased by the bank and social housing mortgage pools originated by the bank that are securitized and sold, qualify for derecognition where the bank transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to third parties. as at october 31, 2024, the outstanding amount of off-balance sheet securitized third-party originated mortgages was $24,837 million (october 31, 2023 – $19,442 million) and off-balance sheet securitized social housing pools was $1,148 million (october 31, 2023 – $766 million). the bank securitizes a portion of its canadian personal and small business credit card receivables (receivables) through trillium credit card trust ii (trillium), a consolidated bank-sponsored structured entity. trillium issues senior and subordinated notes to investors. the proceeds of such issuances are used to purchase co-ownership interests in the receivables originated by the bank. the sale of such co-ownership interests does not qualify for derecognition and therefore the receivables continue to be recognized on the bank’s consolidated statement of financial position. recourse of the noteholders is limited to the purchased co-ownership interests. during the year, $585 million receivables were securitized through trillium (2023 – $2,412 million). guarantees and other commitments guarantees and other commitments are fee-based products that the bank provides to its customers. these products can be categorized as follows: • standby letters of credit and letters of guarantee. as at october 31, 2024, these amounted to $63 billion, compared to $48 billion last year. these instruments are issued at the request of a bank customer to secure the customer’s payment or performance obligations to a third party. management’s discussion

management’s discussion and analysis • liquidity facilities. these generally provide an alternate source of funding to asset-backed commercial paper conduits in the event a general market disruption prevents the conduits from issuing commercial paper or, in some cases, when certain specified conditions or performance measures are not met; • indemnification contracts. in the ordinary course of business, the bank enters into many contracts where it may indemnify contract counterparties for certain aspects of its operations that are dependent on other parties’ performance, or if certain events occur. the bank cannot estimate, in all cases, the maximum potential future amount that may be payable, nor the amount of collateral or assets available under recourse provisions that would mitigate any such payments. historically, the bank has not made any significant payments under these indemnities; • loan commitments. the bank has commitments to extend credit, subject to specific conditions, which represent undertakings to make credit available in the form of loans or other financings for specific amounts and maturities. as at october 31, 2024, these commitments amounted to $273 billion, compared to $284 billion last year. the lower year-over-year amount is primarily due to a decrease in business activity, partially offset by impact from foreign currency translation. these guarantees and loan commitments may expose the bank to credit or liquidity risks, and are subject to the bank’s standard review and approval processes. for the guaranteed products, the dollar amounts represent the maximum risk of loss in the event of a total default by the guaranteed parties, and are stated before any reduction for recoveries under recourse provisions, insurance policies or collateral held or pledged. detailed information on guarantees and loan commitments is disclosed in note 35 in the consolidated financial statements."

items,group_finnacial_condition,"financial instruments given the nature of the bank’s main business activities, financial instruments make up a substantial portion of the bank’s financial position and are integral to the bank’s business. assets that are financial instruments include cash resources, securities, securities purchased under resale agreements, loans and customers’ liability under acceptances. financial instrument liabilities include deposits, acceptances, obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, obligations related to securities sold short, subordinated debentures and capital instrument liabilities. in addition, the bank uses derivative financial instruments for both trading and hedging purposes. financial instruments are generally carried at fair value, except for non-trading loans and receivables, certain securities and most financial liabilities, which are carried at amortized cost unless designated as fair value through profit and loss at inception. unrealized gains and losses on the following items are recorded in other comprehensive income (oci): • debt instruments measured at fair value through oci, • equity instruments measured at fair value through oci, • derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and • financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. gains and losses on derecognition of debt instruments at fvoci are reclassified from oci to the consolidated statement of income under non-interest income. gains and losses on derecognition of equity instruments designated at fvoci are not reclassified from oci to the consolidated statement of income. gains and losses on cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in the consolidated statement of income when the hedged item affects income. the bank’s accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are further described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. interest income and expense on non-trading interest-bearing financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as part of net interest income. credit losses related to loans are recorded in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. interest income and expense, as well as gains and losses, on trading securities and trading loans are recorded in non-interest income – trading revenues. several risks arise from transacting financial instruments, including credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and market risk. the bank manages these risks using extensive risk management policies and practices, including various board-approved risk management limits. a discussion of the bank’s risk management policies and practices can be found in the risk management section on pages 72 to 110. in addition, note 36 to the consolidated financial statements presents the bank’s exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risks arising from financial instruments as well as the bank’s corresponding risk management policies and procedures. there are various measures that reflect the level of risk associated with the bank’s portfolio of financial instruments. for example, the interest rate risk arising from the bank’s financial instruments can be estimated by calculating the impact of a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on annual income, and the economic value of shareholders’ equity, as described on page 93. for trading activities, table t51 discloses the average one-day value at risk by risk factor. for derivatives, based on the maturity profile of the notional amount of the bank’s derivative financial instruments, only 19% (2023 – 20%) had a term to maturity greater than five years. note 11 to the consolidated financial statements provides details about derivatives used in trading and hedging activities, including notional amounts, remaining term to maturity, credit risk and fair values. the fair value of the bank’s financial instruments is provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements along with a description of how these amounts were determined. the fair value of the bank’s financial instruments was unfavourable when compared to their carrying value by $1.4 billion as at october 31, 2024 (october 31, 2023 – unfavourable $4.2 billion). this difference relates mainly to loan assets, debt investment securities measured at amortized cost, deposit liabilities, subordinated debentures and other liabilities. these changes are primarily driven by movements in interest rates and by volume changes. fair value estimates are based on market conditions as at october 31, 2024, and may not be reflective of future fair values. further information on how fair values are estimated is contained in the section on critical accounting policies and estimates. disclosures specific to certain financial instruments designated at fair value through profit and loss can be found in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. these designations were made primarily to significantly reduce accounting mismatches. 70 | 2024 scotiabank annual report"

framework strategic planning financial planning stress testing recovery planning risk appetite effective risk management requires clear articulation of the bank’s risk appetite and how the bank’s risk profile will be managed in relation to that appetite. the enterprise risk appetite framework (“enterprise raf”) governs the risk activities undertaken by the bank on an enterprise-wide basis. it articulates the amount and type of risk the bank is willing to take to achieve its strategic and financial objectives. a clearly articulated and effectively embedded risk appetite supports a strong risk culture and helps to ensure that the bank stays within the established risk boundaries, while finding an optimal balance between risk and return. the enterprise raf is incorporated into the bank’s, strategic, capital, and financial planning processes, and compensation programs. roles and responsibilities for development and implementation of the enterprise raf are well defined and are embedded in executive management mandates. the enterprise raf is reviewed annually by senior management who recommend it to the board for approval. the bank’s four business lines each have a standalone risk appetite framework which is aligned with the bank’s enterprise raf. the business line rafs are tailored to the operations of the respective business line and include business line specific risk appetite measures. risk management capital planning compensation programs framework strategic planning capit plann financial planning stress testing nsation grams recovery planning risk appetite framework (raf) risk appetite statement the bank’s enterprise raf includes qualitative statements as well as quantitative measures and considers all of the bank’s principal risks. risk appetite metrics help to articulate the bank’s risk appetite in quantitative terms and are critical to ensuring the bank stays within its established risk appetite on an on-going basis. risk appetite metrics are supported by management level limit structures and controls, as applicable. the bank’s risk appetite statement can be summarized as follows:  the bank has no appetite for breaches of our scotiabank code of conduct, and consequences applied are commensurate with the severity of the breach. bank officers and employees are expected to conduct business and interact with others in a legal, compliant, and ethical manner while upholding the bank’s values.  the bank favours businesses that generate sustainable, consistent, and predictable earnings over the business cycle.  the bank limits its risk-taking activities to those that are well understood and can be managed in line with its risk appetite, risk culture, values, and strategic objectives.  the bank strives to maintain a robust and resilient control environment to protect its stakeholders and be prepared operationally and financially to respond to adverse events.  the bank has no appetite for reputational, legal, or regulatory risk that would undermine the trust of our stakeholders.  the bank has no appetite for its products and services to be used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions evasion. the bank takes appropriate action to prevent, detect, and report such activities to regulators in line with applicable laws and regulations.  the bank aims to maintain a strong capital and liquidity position to maintain its reputation as a safe and secure bank.  the bank will use a disciplined, enterprise-wide approach to capital allocation to drive sustainable, profitable growth and maximize shareholder returns. risk appetite metrics risk appetite metrics help to articulate the bank’s risk appetite in quantitative terms and are critical to ensuring the bank stays within its established risk appetite on an on-going basis. risk appetite metrics are supported by management level limit structures and controls, as applicable. other components of scotiabank’s risk appetite metrics:  set risk capacity and appetite in relation to regulatory constraints  use stress testing to provide forward-looking metrics, as applicable  minimize earnings volatility  limit exposure to operational events that can have an impact on earnings, including regulatory fines  ensure reputational risk is top of mind and strategy is being executed within operating parameters management’s discussion and analysis | risk management 2024 scotiabank annual report | 75
management’s discussion and analysis risk management tools effective risk management includes tools that are guided by the bank’s enterprise risk appetite framework and integrated with the bank’s strategies and business planning processes. scotiabank’s risk management framework is supported by a variety of risk management tools that are used individually and/or jointly to manage enterprise-wide risks. risk management tools are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure consistency with risk-taking activities, and relevance to the business and financial strategies of the bank. enterprise risk management processes should provide a view of the bank’s risks in a comprehensive and integrated manner and need to consider the relationships and interconnectivity of risks across the bank. frameworks, policies and limits frameworks and policies the bank develops and maintains frameworks and policies to manage risks and establish clear expectations to control bank activities. frameworks and policies are designed taking into consideration industry best practices, requirements and guidelines of the office of the superintendent of financial institutions (osfi), the bank act, as well as the requirements and expectations of other regulators in the jurisdictions where the bank conducts business. they are developed in consultation with various stakeholders across risk management, other control and corporate functions, business lines and the audit department. frameworks and policies are guided by the bank’s risk appetite, governance standards and set the limits and controls within which the bank and its subsidiaries can operate. risk frameworks and policies may be supported by standards, procedures, guidelines and manuals. the bank also provides advice and counsel to its subsidiaries in respect of their local risk frameworks and policies to promote alignment within the bank. limits limits govern and control risk-taking activities within the appetite and tolerances established by the board and executive management. limits also establish accountability for key tasks in the risk-taking process and establish the level or conditions under which transactions may be approved or executed. risk measurement the bank’s measurement of risk is a key component of its risk management framework. the measurement methodologies may apply to a group of risks or a single risk type and are supported by an assessment of qualitative risk factors to ensure the level of risks is within the bank’s risk appetite. the bank utilizes various risk techniques such as: models; stress testing; scenario and sensitivity analysis; and back testing using data with forward- looking projections based on plausible and worst case economic and financial market events; to support its risk measurement activities. models the use of quantitative risk methodologies and models is subject to effective oversight and a strong governance framework which includes the application of sound and experienced judgment. the development, design, independent review and testing, and approval of models are subject to the model risk management policy. the bank employs models for a number of important risk measurement and management processes including: regulatory and internal capital, internal risk management, valuation/pricing and financial reporting, meeting initial margin requirements, business decision-making for risk management, and stress testing. forward-looking exercises stress testing stress testing programs at both the enterprise-wide level and individual risk level allow the bank to estimate the potential impact on the bank’s performance resulting from significant changes in market conditions, credit environment, liquidity demands, or other risk factors. enterprise-wide stress testing is also integrated with both the strategic and financial planning processes, as well as financial crisis management planning. the development, approval and on-going review of the bank’s stress testing programs are subject to policy, and the oversight of the stress & scenarios committee (ssc) or other management committees as appropriate. the ssc is also responsible for reviewing and approving stress testing, climate risk, and ifrs 9 related scenarios for implementation and use. each stress testing program is developed with input from a broad base of stakeholders, and results are integrated into management decision making processes for capital adequacy and/or allocation, funding requirements and strategy, risk appetite setting and limit determinations. the stress testing programs are designed to capture a number of stress scenarios with differing severities and time horizons. other stress tests are conducted, as required, at the enterprise-wide level and within specific functional areas to test the decision-making processes of the senior management team and key personnel, by simulating a potential stress scenario. simulated stress scenarios may include several complexities and disruptions through which senior management are engaged to make certain key decisions. generally, the objectives of the simulations can include testing (1) the executability of activation protocols, (2) operational readiness, (3) the flexibility of the executive decision- making process, and (4) the process by which actions to be taken are prioritized. the exercises may also be designed to test the applicability and relevance of available data and the timeliness of reporting for decision making under stressed/crisis conditions. monitoring and reporting the bank monitors its risk exposures to ensure business activities are operating within approved risk appetite limits, thresholds or guidelines. metric owners are responsible for regular monitoring, reporting and escalating breaches of early warning thresholds and risk appetite limits or any other deteriorating trends in risk profile to senior management and/or the board, as appropriate. regular risk reporting to senior management and the board of directors provides aggregate measures of risk for all products and business lines, across the bank’s global footprint, and are used to ensure compliance with risk appetite, policies, limits, and guidelines. they also provide a clear statement on the types, amounts, and sensitivities of the various risks in the portfolio. senior management and the board use this information to understand the bank’s risk profile and the performance of the portfolios. a comprehensive summary of the bank’s risk profile and performance of the portfolios is presented to the board of directors on a quarterly basis. 76 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
risk identification and assessment effective risk management requires a comprehensive process to identify risks and assess their materiality. the bank defines risk as the potential impact of deviations from expected outcomes on the bank’s earnings, capital, liquidity, reputation and resilience caused by internal and external vulnerabilities. to support proper risk identification and assessment the risk areas in the bank have developed specific risk taxonomies to assist in the management and governance of the various risks impacting the bank. the risk identification and assessment processes are to comply with the naming conventions set out by the enterprise risk taxonomy for effective data governance and lineage. risk identification and assessment are performed on an ongoing basis through the following:  transactions – risks, including credit and market exposures, are assessed by the business lines as risk owners with grm providing review and effective challenge, as applicable  monitoring – risks are identified by constantly monitoring and reporting current trends and analysis, top and emerging risks and internal and external significant adverse events impacting the bank  new products and services – new or significant change to products, services and/or supporting technology are assessed for potential risks through the new initiatives risk assessment program  strategic investments – investment transactions are thoroughly reviewed for risks and are approved by the operating committee with advice and counsel from the strategic transactions and investment committee who provides direction and guidance on effective allocation and prioritization of resources  self assessments – operational risks through people, processes and systems are periodically self-assessed by the risk owners with the responsible second line of defense providing effective challenge on an annual basis, the bank undergoes a bank-wide risk assessment that identifies the material risks faced by the bank for the internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap) and the determination of internal capital. this process evaluates the risks and determines the pervasiveness of the risk across multiple business lines, the significance of the risk to a specific business line, the likelihood and potential impact of the risk and whether the risk may cause unexpected losses in income and therefore would be mitigated by internal capital. the process also reviews other evolving and emerging risks and includes qualitative considerations such as strategic, economic and esg risk factors. the identified risks are ascribed a rating of how probable and impactful they may be and are used as an important input in the icaap process and the determination of internal capital. as part of this annual risk assessment process, the bank’s principal risks for the year are identified through consultation with various risk owners and/or stakeholders and approved by the operational risk committee and the risk management committee. principal risk types the bank’s principal risk types are reviewed annually as part of the assessment of risks process to determine that they adequately reflect the bank’s risk profile. principal risks are defined as: those risks which management considers of primary importance: i) having a significant impact or influence on the bank’s primary business and revenue generating activities (financial risks) or ii) inherent in the bank’s business and can have significant negative strategic, business, financial and/or reputational consequences (non-financial risks). principal risks are assessed on an annual basis considering, amongst other things, the following factors:  potential impact (direct or indirect) on the bank’s financial results, operations, management and strategy  effect on the bank’s long-term prospects and ongoing viability  regulatory focus and/or social concern  short to mid-term macroeconomic and market environment  financial and human resources required to manage and monitor the risk  establishment of key risk indicators, performance indicators or management limits to monitor and control the risk  peer identification and global best practices  regular monitoring and reporting to the board on the risk is warranted once a principal risk has been identified, governance structures and mechanisms must be in place for that risk:  committee governance structures have been established to manage the risk  dedicated second line resources are in place providing effective challenge 

established limits, and meet the desired strategic priorities and risk return profile. management’s discussion and analysis | risk management 2024 scotiabank annual report | 77
how are culture, risk culture & conduct risk connected? keeping the bank safe culture refers to how an organization risk culture conduct risk culture risk culture is the underlying norms, operates, communicates, and does attitudes and beliefs of individuals and business. groups that drive their risk management behaviour.  scotiabond – the bank’s culture ambition, reflects our bank’s values and behaviours:  bank’s risk culture program is based on four  our values (client-centric, integrity, inclusion, indicators (elements) of a strong risk culture: accountability) guide our day-to-day interactions tone from the top, accountability, risk and decisions. management and people management.  our behaviours (results-driven, shaping the a strong risk culture is fostered by an environment future, striving for better, inclusive) articulate that encourages open communication, where how we win together as one team. employees feel secure to voice concerns, and such issues are properly managed. conduct risk is the behavioural manifestation of our culture and risk culture.  by way of example, conduct risk includes, but not limited to, sales conduct, bribery & corruption, conflicts of interest, insider trading, and market manipulation. management’s discussion and analysis non-financial risks: operational, data, compliance, model, money laundering / terrorist financing and sanctions, environmental, social & governance (esg), cyber security & information technology (it), strategic, reputational these are risks that are inherent in the bank’s business and can have significant negative strategic, business, financial and/or reputational consequences if not managed properly. in comparison to financial risks, non-financial risks are less predictable and more difficult to define and measure. the bank has low risk appetite for non-financial risks and mitigates these accordingly. significant adverse events the bank defines a significant adverse event (sae) as an internally or externally occurring event that has resulted, or may result in, a significant impact on the bank’s financial performance, strategy, reputation, risk appetite, regulatory compliance, or operations. significant is defined as the relative importance of a matter within the context in which it is being considered, including quantitative and qualitative factors, such as magnitude, nature, effect, relevance, and impact. risk culture effective risk management requires a strong, robust, and pervasive risk culture where every bank employee understands and recognizes their role as a risk manager and is responsible for identifying and managing risks. the bank’s risk culture is influenced by numerous factors, including the interdependent relationship amongst the bank’s overarching culture, risk governance structure, risk appetite, strategy, and risk management tools. the bank’s risk culture program is based on four indicators of a strong risk culture: tone from the top, accountability, risk management and people management. a strong risk culture is fostered by an environment that encourages open communication, where employees feel secure to voice concerns, and we build trust by actively listening and seeking to understand diverse perspectives. it promotes behaviours that align to the bank’s culture, values and desired behaviours and enables employees to identify risk taking activities that are beyond the established risk appetite. other elements that influence and support the bank’s risk culture:  scotiabank code of conduct (our “code”): describes standards of conduct required of employees, contingent workers, directors and officers of the bank. all scotiabankers are required to receive, read and comply with our code, and any other applicable scotiabank policies and affirm their compliance within the required timeline on an annual basis  values: client-centric – deliver a differentiated experience that creates value for our clients; integrity – make the right decisions for our clients, each other, and our bank; inclusion – value and leverage differences and diverse perspectives; accountability – take initiative to sustainably and profitably grow our bank  communication: the bank actively communicates risk appetite, and how it relates to scotiabankers, to promote a sound risk culture  compensation: programs are structured to comply with compensation-related principles and regulations and discourage behaviours that are not aligned with the bank’s values and our code and ensure that such behaviours are not rewarded  training: risk culture is continually reinforced by providing effective and informative mandatory and non-mandatory training modules for all employees on a variety of risk management topics  decision-making on risk issues is highly centralized: the flow of information and transactions to senior and executive committees keeps management well informed of the risks the bank faces and ensures that transactions and risks are aligned with the bank’s risk appetite  employee goals: all employees are assigned an accountability goal addressing how they execute on their performance goals and operate in alignment with scotiabank’s defined culture, values, behaviours, and in compliance with all policies and procedures  executive mandates: all executives across the bank have risk management responsibilities within their mandates 78 | 2024 scotiabank annual report

management’s discussion and analysis top and emerging risks the bank is exposed to a variety of top and emerging risks. these risks can potentially affect the bank’s business strategies, financial performance, and reputation. as part of our risk management approach, we monitor our operating environment to identify, assess, review, and manage a broad range of top and emerging risks to undertake appropriate risk mitigation strategies. risks are identified using a risk identification system whereby information is gathered and consolidated from a variety of internal and external sources including industry research and peer analysis, senior management expertise, and risk reporting from our international operations. the results of this research, in conjunction with internal impact assessments across the bank’s principal risks and other stakeholders, help identify top and emerging risks, which, along with mitigation activities, are summarized and reported to executives and the board of directors on a quarterly basis. the external risk environment is characterized by an unprecedented rate of change and interconnectivity on a global scale. emerging risks are becoming less predictable and require a more agile approach to respond quickly to mitigate their impacts. while emerging risks continue to be concentrated in non-financial risks, they have the potential to interact and amplify other risks, including financial ones, in ways that can be difficult to predict. the bank’s top and emerging risks are as follows: evolving cyber security threats as technology advances, cyber threats continue to evolve in sophistication and scope posing as a top risk to the bank and/or its third-party service providers. this continues to be a top concern. these threats manifest as attacks on critical functions or infrastructure, including but not limited to, customer facing systems and may result in financial loss, data theft, regulatory consequences, reputational damage or operational disruption to the bank. the inherent risk of cyber security threats continues to increase as attack surfaces grow with the adoption of new technologies and cloud services. geopolitical conflicts have increased the severity and frequency of cyber threats and state-sanctioned cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, public facing services and emerging technologies. advancements in generative ai and large language models (llm) create additional attack vectors that enable new forms of fraud or are used to exfiltrate sensitive data and personal identifiable information. the bank’s overall cyber security and it program continues to adapt to the evolving and complex cyber threat landscape, and investments in cyber defences, including proactive and adaptive security measures, and it infrastructure to strengthen its operational resilience. as threat actors look to exploit the weakest link in a system, frequent monitoring of critical suppliers and effective contingency planning helps mitigate the vulnerability to cyber attacks on third parties and safeguards critical assets to ensure business continuity. the bank also maintains cyber insurance coverage to help mitigate potential losses linked to cyber incidents. the insurance coverage limit is regularly reviewed and evaluated to ensure it meets our needs. economic uncertainty after a period of elevated interest rates, most central banks have started easing their policy rates, which should support economic activity. however, the lag effects of higher interest rates may increase portfolio impacts, including provisions and delinquencies as clients continue to face higher refinancing costs. liquidity and market risk uncertainty may result in stricter credit conditions, which can impact business growth, delinquencies, and collateral valuations. the bank’s strategic shift places focus on allocating capital to more mature, priority markets with an emphasis on lower cost deposits and client primacy that helps reduce credit risk. frequent monitoring of liquidity, deposit levels, and credit quality will keep the bank adept in responding to a changing environment and protect against potential impacts of macroeconomic uncertainty. portfolios are monitored for delinquency trends, and collections measures are being deployed to mitigate potential impacts to the bank’s most vulnerable borrowers. impacts from climate change adaptation and mitigation rising costs of climate change and new climate guidelines increase regulatory oversight and stakeholder expectations to demonstrate strong governance in managing climate risks. the increased intensity and frequency of severe weather events highlights the potential impacts of diverse physical risks due to climate change, which include damage to properties and disruptions to operations that can negatively impact profitability. political uncertainty and changing government priorities could result in step-backs from environmental commitments and slow net-zero investments and client support to mitigate climate risks. under current laws and evolving climate regulations, which include management of nature- related risks and their impacts, making exaggerated or misleading sustainability claims or “greenwashing”, either intentionally or due to data collection and reporting challenges, can create legal and reputational risks. for further details please refer to the esg risk section on page 108. the bank has several mechanisms to identify, mitigate, and assess potential bank losses from physical risks. disaster recovery planning is focused on ensuring uninterrupted operations for localized disasters and weather-related events. the bank has a public esg policy that restricts lending to the oil & gas industry within the arctic and for thermal coal mining or coal power generation. in fiscal 2024 the bank also introduced additional exclusionary policies related to lending in unesco world heritage sites and ramsar wetlands. the bank continues to support clients as they transition to net-zero, and has set emissions reduction targets by 2030 in oil and gas, power and utilities, and automotive manufacturing sectors as outlined in the bank’s 2024 climate report. economic impacts of geopolitical tensions the potential for political miscalculations and conflict escalations remains a key concern. geopolitical uncertainty and a fracturing global economy, including a new u.s. administration, growing u.s.-china tensions, the continuing war in ukraine, and ongoing conflicts in the middle east, could add complexity to the geopolitical environment and pose fresh threats to the global economy by disrupting supply chains and increasing commodity prices. trade disputes challenge the globalized economy, prompting some governments to promote manufacturing diversification among ‘allies’ for resource, technology, and product security. though such measures seek to mitigate the economic impacts of geopolitical risk, such policies may raise costs and inefficiencies in capital deployment and allocation. the bank seeks to grow and do business in countries that have a track record of economic growth and institutional stability. the bank monitors geopolitical developments through various pillars and threat intelligence coordination, and monitors regions with geopolitical conflicts to ensure sanctions related controls continue to be fully compliant with evolving laws. the bank’s stress testing programs help evaluate the potential impacts of severe economic scenarios, and the bank can draw from its extensive experience operating in emerging markets across the globe to manage volatility, and right scaling exposure when necessary. the bank’s strong and varied client base, robust liquidity levels and diversified funding programs help manage disruptions or market dislocations. 80 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
increased regulatory obligations and government policy uncertainty as a global financial institution, the bank operates under various legal and regulatory frameworks that affect its businesses. the increasing volume, complexity, and pace of regulatory obligations, combined with changing government policies across the bank’s footprint is competing for limited resources and is a challenge when balancing compliance with innovation amidst growing competition in the non-regulated financial industry. the bank strives to monitor and evaluate the emerging regulatory developments and to implement the necessary changes to ensure compliance. however, any inadvertent non-compliance may expose the bank to fines, penalties, litigation, regulatory sanctions, enforcement actions and restrictions or prohibitions on its business activities. these consequences may adversely affect the bank’s financial performance, its business strategy execution and its reputation. the bank continues to monitor changes in regulatory guidance from regulators and to assess the impact of new regulations and increasing scrutiny across its operating footprint. it continues to coordinate examinations as part of its compliance program and work with peers to promote consistent guidance and requirements across jurisdictions. to meet increasing regulatory obligations the bank is investing in infrastructure to addresses immediate challenges while building resilience for the years ahead, supported by a robust funding model and risk culture with the appropriate regulatory talent. for additional information on some of the key regulatory developments that potentially impact the bank’s operations, see “regulatory developments” on page 116. resilience to third party risks the bank continues to rely on third parties for the delivery of some critical services. the growing concentration of dominant third and nth parties for the delivery of these critical services, combined with attempts to keep up with technological advancements in a volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, requires oversight and monitoring of complex third- and nth-party arrangements, and increases regulatory, operational, data and cyber risk for service providers. using third-party service providers increases the risk of attacks, breaches, or disruptions due to the bank’s reduced oversight and control over their technology and security. this can interrupt critical functions or infrastructure, including but not limited to, customer facing systems and may result in financial loss, data theft, regulatory consequences, reputational damage or operational disruption to the bank. resiliency and preparedness for third party disruptions, including contingency planning and identification of alternative vendors, is an area of increasing focus as individual banks are expected to coordinate and manage the systemic risks associated with critical third parties notwithstanding disparate regulations. the bank aims to be “resilient by design” and has established an operational resilience program to support engagements with third party service providers, including defining critical suppliers, enhancing continuous monitoring and developing vendor disruption strategies. the bank continues to invest in enhancing its governance of third parties, resourcing capabilities, and technology to ensure it manages third party risk prudently. increased fraud threats fraud risk arises from numerous sources, both internal and external, including service providers to the bank and its customers. the bank, and industry as a whole, continues to be exposed to the threat of increasing fraud given the uncertain economic climate, rapid digitization, and the adoption of new technologies. despite the bank’s investments in fraud prevention and detection programs, capabilities, measures and defences, it may not successfully mitigate against all fraudulent activity which could result in financial loss, reputational damage or operational disruptions in the bank’s businesses. the bank is continuously enhancing its fraud oversight functions and governance structures to ensure a coordinated response to fraud attacks and to support future business growth in line with its strategy. reliance on data and models in decision making the increasing role of models and data in decision making processes and operations, potential for bias, and increasing sensitivities and concerns on appropriate use of data in the decision-making process, can all result in reputational risk. models leveraging data with poor quality can increase the likelihood of incorrect conclusions and inaccurate insights hindering the bank’s assessment and disclosure of key data needed to meet regulatory disclosure requirements, which could raise the bank’s compliance and operational costs. adoption of new technology (e.g., generative ai/large language models) in financial services can create new risks, such as potential copyrights and intellectual property infringement, spread of misinformation, and inaccuracy of model output stability in model performance impacting reliability for decision making. new regulatory guidelines have expanded model definitions increasing model volumes and data governance requirements which could result in higher costs and new resource requirements. the bank has policies that outline guiding principles on how to manage the risks of using models and data, in alignment to the latest regulations on data and ai, while incorporating data ethics into its code of conduct and training. the bank continues to modernize its model development and validation platforms following a risk-based approach, which includes cloud adoption, investing in better modeling tools and increasing automation to shorten model lifecycles and manage increasing regulatory oversight of models. failure to adapt to technological change and competitive risks risks and impacts emanating from digital innovations such as cloud computing, generative ai, machine learning and process automation, require continued investments by the bank to adapt to these new technologies in order to respond to changing customer needs, regulatory expectations, and cyber threats, while staying competitive with peers and new entrants. rapid digitalization has created greater dependency on technology to carry out critical business processes and as digital service usage continues to increase, stakeholder tolerance for downtime has reduced. technology is a focus for the bank and is a key enabler for the bank’s clients to do business easily, for automating processes, and for driving innovation, including better risk analytics. managing legacy it platforms and complex change management processes is an increasing risk focus as adoption of new technologies requires increasing speed to keep pace with a rapidly changing digital landscape. the bank is strategically increasing its technology investments to address legacy platforms, which should reduce system vulnerabilities and increase flexibility to adopt new technologies cost-effectively. focus remains on ensuring sufficient resourcing for software updates and to accelerating the remediation of expired software, while cloud investments should support software modernization and application rationalization. the bank is addressing the risks of adopting generative ai, including malicious use, data vulnerabilities, and regulatory scrutiny, by establishing ai risk guidelines and leveraging existing data and model governance frameworks for ethical and sound adoption across business lines. failure to adapt to execute on strategic objectives execution of strategic objectives is contingent upon navigating an external environment driven by changing government priorities, increasing geopolitical tensions and the accelerating pace of regulatory scrutiny and obligations that could require strategic adjustments. the bank has aligned its operations to core strategic objectives while remaining agile to adapt to the evolving external environment to help ensure strategic goals are met, while continuing to communicate transparently with investors and other stakeholders. 2024 scotiabank annual report | 81 management’s discussion and analysis | risk management"
84,88,management’s discussion and analysis principal risks – financial credit risk,better-than-expected productivity performance is resulting in an upward revision to our u.s. gdp over the forecast period,risk_management,"management’s discussion and analysis principal risks – financial credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honour its financial or contractual obligations to the bank. credit risk arises in the bank’s direct lending operations, and in its funding, investment and trading activities where counterparties have repayment or other obligations to the bank. credit risk summary • the bank’s overall loan book as of october 31, 2024 decreased to $768 billion versus $776 billion as of october 31, 2023, with changes reflected in personal, and business and government lending. residential mortgages were $351 billion as of october 31, 2024, with 85% in canada. the corporate loan book, which accounts for 38% of the total loan book is composed of 51% of loans with an investment grade rating as of october 31, 2024, compared to 55% of the total loan book in october 31, 2023. • loans and acceptances (personal, and business and government lending) remained diversified by region, industry and customer. regional exposure is spread across our key markets (canada 68%, united states 8%, chile 6%, mexico 6% and other 12%). financial services constitutes 4% of overall gross exposures (before consideration of collateral) and was $31 billion. these exposures are predominately to highly rated counterparties and are generally collateralized. the effective management of credit risk requires the establishment of an appropriate risk culture. key credit risk policies and appetite statements are important elements used to create this culture. the board of directors, either directly or through the risk committee (the board), reviews and approves the bank’s credit risk appetite limits annually and credit risk policy limits and thresholds biennially. • the objectives of the credit risk appetite are to ensure that: – target markets and product offerings are well defined at both the enterprise-wide and business line levels; – the risk parameters for new underwritings and for the portfolios as a whole are clearly specified; and – transactions, including origination, syndication, loan sales and hedging, are managed in a manner that is consistent with the bank’s risk appetite. • the credit risk policy articulates the credit risk management framework, including: – credit risk management policies; – delegation of authority; – the credit risk management program; – credit risk management for trading and investment activities; and – single name and aggregate limits, beyond which credit applications must be escalated to the board for approval. grm develops the credit risk management framework and policies that detail, among other things, the credit risk rating systems and associated parameter estimates; the delegation of authority for granting credit; the methodology and calculation of the allowance for credit losses; and the authorization of write-offs. corporate and commercial credit exposures are segmented by various business lines and/or by major industry type. aggregate credit risk limits for each of these segments are also reviewed and approved biennially by the board. portfolio management objectives and risk diversification are key factors in setting these limits. consistent with the board-approved limits, borrower limits are set within the context of established lending criteria and guidelines for individual borrowers, particular industries, countries and certain types of lending, to ensure the bank does not have excessive concentration to any single borrower, or related group of borrowers, particular industry sector or geographic region. through the portfolio management process, loans may be syndicated to reduce overall exposure to a single name. for certain segments of the portfolio, credit derivative contracts are also used to mitigate the risk of loss due to borrower default. risk is also mitigated through the selective sale of loans. banking units and grm regularly review the various segments of the credit portfolio on an enterprise-wide basis to assess the impact of economic trends or specific events on the performance of the portfolio, and to determine whether corrective action is required. these reviews include the examination of the risk factors for particular products, industries and countries. the results of these reviews are reported to the risk management committee and, when significant, to the board. risk measures the bank’s credit risk rating systems support the determination of key credit risk parameter estimates (probability of default (pd), loss-given- default (lgd) and exposure at default (ead)) that are applicable to both retail and business banking portfolios and are designed to measure customer credit and transaction risk. the parameters are an integral part of enterprise-wide policies and procedures encompassing governance, risk management, and control structure, and are used in various internal and regulatory credit risk quantification calculations. the bank’s credit risk rating system is subject to a comprehensive validation, governance and oversight framework. the objectives of this framework are to ensure that: • credit risk rating methodologies and parameters are appropriately designed and developed, independently validated, and regularly reviewed, and that the results of each process are adequately documented; and • the validation process represents an effective challenge to the design and development process including an assessment of risk measures. the bank’s credit risk rating methodologies and parameters are reviewed and validated at least annually. units within grm are responsible for design, and development of credit risk rating methodologies and parameters. separate units within grm are responsible for validation and review. the operation of these separate units is functionally independent from the business units responsible for originating exposures. within grm, these units are also independent from the units involved in risk rating approval and credit adjudication. business banking credit risk ratings and associated risk parameters affect lending decisions, and loan pricing. both business banking and retail banking’s credit risk rating systems affect the computation of the allowance for credit losses, and regulatory capital. 82 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
corporate and commercial corporate and commercial credit exposure arises in the bank’s business lines. risk ratings the bank’s risk rating system utilizes internal grade (ig) ratings – a 17 point scale used to differentiate the risk of default of borrowers, and the risk of loss on facilities. the general relationship between the bank’s ig ratings and external agency ratings is shown in table t34. ig ratings are also used to define credit adjudication authority levels appropriate to the size and risk of each credit application. lower-rated credits require increasingly more senior management involvement depending upon the aggregate exposure. where a credit exceeds the authority delegated to a credit unit, credit units will refer the request – with its recommendation – to a senior credit committee for adjudication. in certain cases, these must be referred to the risk committee of the board of directors. adjudication credit adjudication units within grm analyze and evaluate all significant credit requests for corporate and commercial credit exposures, to ensure that risks are adequately assessed, properly approved, continually monitored and actively managed. the decision-making process begins with an assessment of the credit risk of the individual borrower or counterparty. key factors considered in the assessment include: • the borrower’s management; • the borrower’s current and projected financial results and credit statistics; • the industry in which the borrower operates; • environmental and climate change risks (including regulatory or reputational impacts); • economic trends; and • geopolitical risk. based on this assessment, a risk rating is assigned to the individual borrower or counterparty, using the bank’s risk rating systems. a separate risk rating is also assigned at the facility level, taking into consideration additional factors, such as security, seniority of claim, structure, term and any other forms of credit risk mitigation that affect the amount of potential loss in the event of a default of the facility. security typically takes the form of charges over inventory, receivables, real estate, and operating assets when lending to corporate and commercial borrowers; and cash or treasuries for trading lines such as securities lending, repurchase transactions, and derivatives. the types of acceptable collateral, and related valuation processes are documented in risk management policies and manuals. other forms of credit risk mitigation include third party guarantees and, in the case of derivatives facilities, master netting agreements. internal borrower and facility risk ratings are assigned when a facility is first authorized, and are promptly re-evaluated and adjusted, if necessary, as a result of changes to the customer’s financial condition or business prospects. re-evaluation is an ongoing process, and is done in the context of general economic changes, specific industry prospects, and event risks, such as revised financial projections, interim financial results and extraordinary announcements. the internal credit risk ratings are also considered as part of the bank’s adjudication limits. single borrower limits are much lower for higher risk borrowers than low risk borrowers. the credit adjudication process also uses a risk-adjusted profitability model to ensure that the client and transaction structure offers an appropriate return for a given level of risk. for the corporate portfolio, and the large borrowers in international, the loan portfolio management group reviews the profitability model results, together with external benchmarks, and provides an opinion on the relative return and pricing of each transaction above a minimum threshold. individual credit exposures are regularly monitored by both the business line units and grm for any signs of deterioration. in addition, the business line units and grm conduct a review and risk analysis of each borrower annually, or more frequently for higher-risk borrowers. if, in the judgement of management, an account requires the expertise of specialists in workouts and restructurings, it will be transferred to a special accounts management group for monitoring and resolution. credit risk mitigation – collateral/security traditional non-retail products (e.g. operating lines of credit, term loans) collateral values are accurately identified at the outset and throughout the tenure of a transaction by using standard evaluation methodologies. collateral valuation estimates are conducted at a frequency that is appropriate to the frequency by which the market value fluctuates, using the collateral type and the borrower risk profile. in addition, when it is not cost effective to monitor highly volatile collateral (e.g. accounts receivable, inventory), appropriate lending margins are applied to compensate (e.g. accounts receivable are capped at 80% of value, inventory at 50%). the frequency of collateral valuations is also increased when early warning signals of a borrower’s deteriorating financial condition are identified. borrowers are required to confirm adherence to covenants including confirmation of collateral values on a periodic basis, which are used by the bank to provide early warning signals of collateral value deterioration. periodic inspections of physical collateral are performed where appropriate and where reasonable means of doing so are available. bank procedures require verification, including certification by banking officers during initial, annual, and periodic reviews, that collateral values/ margins/etc. have been assessed and, where necessary, steps have been taken to mitigate any decreased collateral values. the bank does not use automated valuation models (avms) for valuation purposes for traditional non-retail products. grm performs its own valuations of companies based on various factors such as book value, discounted book value, enterprise value etc. commercial/corporate real estate new or updated appraisals are generally obtained at inception of a new facility, as well as during loan modifications, loan workouts and troubled debt restructure. the primary reason for requiring a new appraisal is if, in the reasonable opinion of the banking execution unit, or grm, there has been a material change in value. additionally, none of the appraisal guidelines contained within the policies dissuade the bank from requesting an appraisal more frequently if an adverse change in market conditions, sponsorship, credit worthiness, or other underwriting assumptions is realized or expected. management’s discussion and analysis | risk management 2024 scotiabank annual report | 83
management’s discussion and analysis appraisals must be in writing and must contain sufficient information and analysis to support the bank’s decision to make the loan. moreover, in rendering an opinion of the property’s market value, third party appraisers are responsible for establishing the scope of work necessary to develop credible assignment results. the appraisal must meet the regulatory and industry requirements which, depending on the type of property being appraised, contain any or all of the following three approaches to value: i. comparable sales approach ii. replacement cost approach iii. income approach the appraiser must disclose the rationale for the omission of any valuation approach. furthermore, the appraiser must disclose whether the subject property was physically inspected and whether anyone provided significant assistance to the person signing the appraisal report. the report must contain a presentation and explanation of the assumptions used in determining value under each of the above mentioned approaches. review of every appraisal is conducted by the banking units and grm to confirm that the appraisal identifies all of the relevant issues for the specific asset class, location and economic environment and incorporates all appropriate valuation methodologies and assumptions. in most cases, the banking units also include comparable properties in addition to what is included in the appraisal to further justify value. when third party assessors are used, they must be accredited and satisfactory to the bank. in addition, grm validates any third party valuations via internal desktop estimates either based on comparables or discounted income valuations. traded products traded products are transactions such as otc derivatives (including foreign exchange and commodity based transactions), and securities financing transactions (including repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending/borrowing). credit risks arising from traded products cannot be determined with certainty at the outset, because during the tenure of a transaction the dollar value of the counterparty’s obligation to the bank will be affected by changes in the capital markets (such as changes in stock prices, interest rates, and exchange rates). the bank adjudicates credit exposures arising from transacting in traded products by considering their current fair value plus an additional component to reflect potential future changes in their mark-to-market value. the credit adjudication process also includes an evaluation of potential wrong-way risk, which arises when the exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated to the probability of default of that counterparty. credit risk associated with traded products is managed within the same credit adjudication process as the lending business. the bank considers the credit risk arising from lending activities, as well as the potential credit risk arising from transacting in traded products with that counterparty. credit risk mitigation – collateral/security derivatives are generally transacted under industry standard international swaps and derivatives association (isda) master netting agreements, which allow for a single net settlement of all transactions covered by that agreement in the event of a default or early termination of the transactions. isda agreements are frequently accompanied by an isda credit support annex (csa), the terms of which may vary according to each party’s view of the other party’s creditworthiness. csas and regulation in some jurisdictions can require both parties to post initial margin (regulatory and non-regulatory). csas also allow for variation margin to be called if total uncollateralized mark-to-market exposure exceeds an agreed upon threshold. such variation margin provisions can be one-way (only one party will ever post collateral) or bilateral (either party may post depending upon which party is in-the-money). the csa will also detail the types of collateral that are acceptable to each party, and the haircuts that will be applied against each collateral type. the terms of the isda master netting agreements and csas are taken into consideration in the calculation of counterparty credit risk exposure. for derivative transactions, investment grade counterparties account for approximately 89% of the credit risk. approximately 41% of the bank’s derivative counterparty exposures are to bank counterparties, as defined under basel iii revision. after taking into consideration, where applicable, netting and collateral arrangements, no net credit risk amount arising from traded products transactions with any single counterparty was considered material to the financial position of the bank as at october 31, 2024. no individual exposure to an investment grade bilateral counterparty exceeded $1,855 million and no individual exposure to a corporate counterparty exceeded $579 million. retail retail credit exposures arise in the canadian banking and international banking business lines. adjudication the decision-making process for retail loans ensures that credit risks are adequately assessed, properly approved, continually monitored and actively managed. generally, credit decisions and limit assignments for consumer loans are processed by proprietary adjudication software and are based on strategies that utilize a robust combination of key financial and customer risk indicators and segmentation in addition to credit bureau information and internal risk ratings generated using predictive credit scoring models. the bank’s credit adjudication and portfolio management methodologies are designed to ensure consistent underwriting and early identification of problem loans in line with our risk appetite. the bank’s rigorous credit underwriting and retail risk strategies and modeling methodologies are more customer focused than product focused. the bank’s view is that a customer-centric approach provides better risk assessment than product- based approaches, a more consistent experience to the customer, and should result in lower loan losses over time. all credit scoring and policy changes are initiated by units within grm that are functionally independent from the business units responsible for retail portfolios. risk models and parameters are also subject to independent validation and review from the units involved in the design and development of models. the review process includes referral to the appropriate senior credit committee for approval, where required. consumer credit portfolios are reviewed at least monthly to identify emerging trends in loan quality and to assess whether corrective action is required. risk ratings the bank’s consumer risk rating systems are oriented to borrower or transaction risk. each retail exposure is assigned a risk grade based on the customer’s credit history and/or internal credit score. the bank’s automated risk rating systems assess the ongoing credit-worthiness of individual customers on a monthly basis. this process provides for meaningful and timely identification and management of problem loans. 84 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
the risk rating system under the airb approach is subject to regular review and ongoing performance monitoring of key components. risk model validations are conducted independently from the areas responsible for rating system development and implementation, to ensure effective independence in design and performance review. customer behavior characteristics which are used as inputs within the bank’s basel iii airb models are consistent with those used by the bank’s canadian consumer risk rating systems. the international portfolios are subject to the standardized approach at this time. credit risk mitigation – collateral/security the property values for residential real estate secured exposures are confirmed at origination through a variety of validation methodologies, including avm and full appraisals (in-person inspection). the appraisal is completed by a third party, bank approved appraiser. for monitoring of material portfolios, property values are indexed quarterly to house prices. for loan impairment within material portfolios, residential property values are re-confirmed using third party avms. where avm values are used, these avm values are subject to routine validation through a continuous random sampling process that back-tests avm values against available property appraisals (primarily third party avms). where third party appraisals are obtained, the bank relies on the professional industry accreditation of the appraiser. samples of approved appraisal reports are reviewed by the bank’s senior appraisers to ensure consistent appraisal quality and satisfactory appraisal values. the third party appraisers are selected from a pre-approved list of bank-vetted appraisers. credit quality ifrs 9 financial instruments, requires the consideration of past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information over the life of the exposure to measure expected credit losses. furthermore, to assess significant increases in credit risk, ifrs 9 requires that entities assess changes in the risk of a default occurring over the expected life of a financial instrument when determining staging. consistent with the requirements of ifrs 9, the bank considers both quantitative and qualitative information in the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. the bank’s models are calibrated to consider past performance and macroeconomic forward-looking variables as inputs, as further described below. in the current year, the bank enhanced certain of its ifrs 9 models, with the enhanced models exhibiting higher sensitivity to changes in the macroeconomic outlook. expert credit judgement may be applied in circumstances where, in the bank’s view, the inputs, assumptions, and/or modelling techniques do not capture all relevant risk factors, including the emergence of economic or political events of the market up to the date of the financial statements. expert credit judgement is applied in the assessment of underlying credit deterioration and migration of balances to progressive stages. the bank has generated a forward-looking base case scenario and three alternate forward-looking scenarios (one optimistic and two pessimistic) as key inputs into the expected credit loss provisioning models. over the last year, the canadian and u.s. economies continued to exhibit resilience in the face of restrictive monetary policy, supported by still strong labour markets and consumption, particularly in the u.s., with both economies on track to record stronger economic growth in 2024 than forecast last year. notwithstanding the upward revision to growth, in canada, more clear signs of slowing emerged over the past few months, with excess supply opening up room for the bank of canada to begin monetary policy easing earlier this year as inflation continued to decline. in the u.s., a more robust labour market and fiscal stimulus led to more substantial revisions to growth and slower progress on inflation, with the u.s. central bank cutting a quarter later than previously expected. it appears a soft-landing has been achieved, with a reacceleration of growth in 2025 expected in canada from the orderly slowdown of 2024. in the u.s., a mild deceleration relative to 2024 is expected, yet it is still stronger than the forecast in 2023. the optimistic scenario features somewhat stronger economic activity relative to the base case. the pessimistic scenario features a negative demand-type shock on the world economy with globally tighter private financial conditions, weaker growth and inflation, and lower monetary policy rates than in the baseline scenario. lastly, the very pessimistic scenario features a strong stagflationary impulse that leads to a protracted period of financial market uncertainty. this results in higher inflation, requiring central banks to raise their policy rate to higher levels than in the base case in order to bring inflation under control, which is dampening economic activity. management’s discussion and analysis | risk management 2024 scotiabank annual report | 85

94,96,management’s discussion and analysis market risk market risk,t50 structural interest sensitivity,risk_management,"management’s discussion and analysis market risk market risk is the risk of loss from changes in market prices and rates (including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices), the correlations between them, and their levels of volatility. market risk includes trading risk, investment risk, structural interest rate risk and structural foreign exchange risk. below is an index of market risk disclosures: market risk factors interest rate risk the risk of loss due to changes in the level and/or the volatility of interest rates. this risk affects instruments such as, but not limited to, debt securities, loans, mortgages, deposits and derivatives. interest rate risks are managed through sensitivity analysis (including economic value of equity and net interest income), stress testing, and var limits and mitigated through portfolio diversification and hedges using interest rate derivatives and debt securities. credit spread risk the risk of loss due to changes in the market price and volatility of credit, or the creditworthiness of issuers. this risk is mainly concentrated in loan and debt securities portfolios. risk is managed through sensitivity, jump-to-default, stress testing and var limits and mitigated through hedges using credit derivatives. foreign currency risk the risk of loss resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and exchange rate volatility. foreign currency denominated debt and other securities as well as future cash flows in foreign currencies are exposed to this type of risk. risk is managed through sensitivity, stress testing and var limits and mitigated through hedges using foreign exchange positions and derivatives. equity risk the risk of loss due to changes in prices, volatility or any other equity related risk factor of individual equity or equity linked securities. this risk affects instruments such as, but not limited to, equities, exchange traded funds, mutual funds, derivatives and other equity linked products. risk is managed through sensitivity, stress testing and var limits and mitigated through hedges using physical equity and derivatives instruments. commodity risk the risk of loss due to changes in prices or volatility of metal, energy and agriculture products. risk is managed through sensitivity, stress testing and var limits and mitigated through derivative hedges. the following maps risk factors to trading and non-trading activities: non-trading funding interest rate risk foreign currency risk investments interest rate risk credit spread risk foreign currency risk equity risk trading interest rate risk credit spread risk foreign currency risk equity risk commodity risk market risk governance overview the board of directors revie ws and approves marke t risk polic ies and limits annually. the bank’s asse t-liability committee (alco) and market risk management and policy committee (mrmpc) oversee the application of the framework set by the board, and monitor the bank’s market risk exposures and the activities that give rise to these exposures. the mrmpc establishes specific operating policies and sets limits at the product, portfolio, business unit and business line levels, and for the bank in total. limits are reviewed at least annually. global risk management provides independent oversight of all significant market risks, supporting the mrmpc and alco with analysis, risk measurement, monitoring, reporting, proposals for standards and support for new product development. to ensure compliance with policies and limits, market risk exposures are independently monitored on a continuing basis, either by global risk management or the back offices. they provide senior management, business units, the alco, and the mrmpc with a series of reports on market risk exposures by business line and risk type. market risk is also managed through the use of a variety of hedging instruments, including derivatives and securities. these instruments are approved for trading by global risk management and the effectiveness of hedging activity is captured through limits on net exposure to risk factors. the bank uses a variety of metrics and models to measure and control market risk exposures. these measurements are selected based on an assessment of the nature of risks in a particular activity. the principal measurement techniques applied to market risk exposure are value at risk (var), stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. the use and attributes of each of these techniques are noted in the risk measurement summary. risk measurement summary value at risk (var) var is a statistical method of measuring potential loss due to market risk based upon a common confidence interval and time horizon. the bank calculates var daily using a 99% confidence level, and a one-day holding period for its trading portfolios. this means that once in every 100 days, the trading positions are expected to lose more than the var estimate. var has two components: general market risk and debt specific risk. the bank calculates general market risk var using historical simulation based on 300 days of market data. obligor specific risk on debt instruments and credit derivatives not captured in general market risk var is calculated through the debt specific risk var, which uses historical resampling. all material risk factors are captured in var. where historical data is not available, proxies are used to establish the relevant volatility for var until sufficient data is available. changes in var between reporting periods are generally due to changes in positions, volatilities and/or correlations 92 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
between asset classes. backtesting is also an important and necessary part of the var process. the bank backtests the actual trading profit and loss against the var result to validate the quality and accuracy of the bank’s var model. the board reviews var results quarterly. stress testing a limitation of var is that it only reflects the recent history of market volatility. to complement this measure, stress testing examines the impact that abnormally large changes in market factors and periods of prolonged inactivity might have on trading portfolios. stress testing scenarios are designed to include large shifts in risk factors as well as historical and theoretical multi risk market events. historical scenarios capture severe movements over periods that are significantly longer than the one-day holding period captured in var, such as the silicon valley bank crisis scenario, covid-19 scenario or the 2008 financial crisis scenario. stress testing is a dynamic tool which provides management with information on potential losses due to tail events. the bank subjects its trading portfolios to a series of daily stress tests. the stress testing program is an essential component of the bank’s comprehensive risk management framework which complements the var methodology and other risk measures and controls employed by the bank. sensitivity analysis in trading portfolios, sensitivity analysis is used to measure the effect of changes in risk factors, including prices and volatility, on financial products and portfolios. these measures apply across product types and geographies and are used for limit monitoring and management reporting. in non-trading portfolios, sensitivity analysis assesses the effect of changes in interest rates on current earnings and on the economic value of equity. it is applied globally to each of the major currencies within the bank’s operations. the bank’s sensitivity analysis for limit and disclosure purposes is measured through positive and negative parallel shifts in the underlying interest rate curves. these calculations are based on models that consider a number of inputs and are on a constant balance sheet and make no assumptions for management actions that may mitigate the risks. the bank also performs sensitivity analysis using various non-parallel interest rate curve shifts, for example: curve steepeners, curve flatteners and curve twists. validation of market risk models prior to the implementation of new market risk models, rigorous validation and testing are conducted. validation is conducted when the model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to the model. the models are also subject to ongoing validation, the frequency of which is determined by model risk ratings. models may also be triggered for earlier revalidation when there have been significant structural changes in the market or changes to the composition of the portfolio. model validation includes backtesting, and additional analysis such as: • theoretical review or tests to demonstrate whether assumptions made within the internal model are appropriate; and • impact tests including stress testing that would occur under historical and hypothetical market conditions. the validation process is governed by the bank’s model risk management policy. market risk from cva credit valuation adjustment (cva) is the adjustment to risk free mark-to-market value of transactions to account for the potential default of a counterparty. cva risk is the risk of loss arising from changing cva values in response to changes in counterparty credit spreads and market risk factors. the cva risk management framework is governed as part of the bank’s risk management policies which are designed to ensure effective oversight and control of market risk and cva risks. regular risk reporting to senior management provides aggregate measures of risk for cva and is used to ensure compliance with risk appetite, policies, limits, and guidelines. the framework includes independent control units responsible for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of cva risk management practices. these units operate separately from the lines of business to ensure unbiased oversight. regular independent reviews are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the cva risk management and hedging framework. the governance structure and bank policies ensure that data acquisition for cva calculation is independent of the lines of business. senior management is actively involved in the risk control process. they oversee the implementation of policies and procedures to identify, measure, monitor, and control cva risks. updates to the cva risk management framework and policies are approved by senior management committees. senior management receives regular reports on cva risk exposures and the effectiveness of hedging strategies. this continuous monitoring helps in making informed decisions and maintaining a robust risk management framework. non-trading market risk funding and investment activities market risk arising from the bank’s funding and investment activities is identified, managed and controlled through the bank’s asset-liability management processes. the asset-liability committee meets monthly to review risks and opportunities, and evaluate performance including the effectiveness of hedging strategies. interest rate risk interest rate risk arising from the bank’s lending, funding and investment activities is managed in accordance with board-approved policies and global limits, which are designed to control the risk to net interest income and economic value of equity. the net interest income (nii) sensitivity measures the effect of a specified change in interest rates on the bank’s annual net interest income over the next twelve months, while the economic value of equity (eve) sensitivity measures the impact of a specified change in interest rates on the present value of the bank’s net assets. limits for both measurements are set according to the documented risk appetite of the bank. board-level limit utilization is reported to both the asset-liability committee and the board on a regular basis. any limit exceptions are reported according to the limit monitoring and compliance policy of the bank. the net interest income and the economic value of equity result from the differences between yields earned on the bank’s non-trading assets and interest expense paid on its liabilities. net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivities measure the risk to the bank’s earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates that affect the bank’s banking book position. the bank’s banking book position reflects the mismatch of the maturity and re-pricing characteristics between the assets and liabilities and optional elements embedded in the bank’s structural balance sheet (e.g. mortgage prepayment). the mismatch and embedded optional elements are inherent in the non-trading operations of the bank and exposes it to changes of interest rates. the asset-liability committee provides strategic direction for the management of management’s discussion and analysis | risk management 2024 scotiabank annual report | 93
management’s discussion and analysis structural interest rate risk within the risk appetite framework authorized by the board of directors. the asset/liability management strategy is executed by group treasury with the objective of protecting net interest income within established risk tolerances. simulation modeling, sensitivity analysis and stress testing are used to assess exposures and for limit monitoring of the bank’s interest rate risk in the banking book. the bank’s interest rate risk exposure is estimated by simulating the banking book position under a range of rate shocks. the simulations incorporate maturities, renewal, and repricing characteristics of the banking book along with prepayment and redemption behaviour of loans and cashable investment products. calculations are generally based on the earlier of contractual re-pricing or maturity of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities, although certain assets and liabilities such as credit cards and deposits without a fixed maturity are assigned a maturity profile based on the longevity of the exposure. expected prepayments from loans and cashable investment products are also incorporated into the exposure calculations. table t50 shows the pro-forma pre-tax impact on the bank’s net interest income over the next twelve months and economic value of equity of an immediate and sustained 100 basis points parallel increase and decrease in interest rate across major currencies as defined by the bank. the interest rate sensitivities tabulated are based on models that consider a number of inputs and are on a constant balance sheet. there are no assumptions made for management actions that may mitigate risk. based on the bank’s interest rate positions at year-end 2024, an immediate and sustained 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all major currencies and maturities would decrease pre-tax net interest income by approximately $21 million over the next 12 months, assuming no further management actions. during fiscal 2024, this measure ranged between decrease of $21 million and decrease of $93 million. this same increase in interest rates would result in an pre-tax decrease in the present value of the bank’s net assets of approximately $1,338 million. during fiscal 2024, this measure ranged between $1,131 million and $1,587 million. the directional sensitivity of these two key metrics is largely determined by the difference in time horizons (net interest income captures the impact over the next twelve months only, whereas economic value considers the potential impact of interest rate changes on the present value of all future cash flows). the net interest income and economic value results are compared to the authorized board limits. both interest rate sensitivities remained within the bank’s approved consolidated limits in the reporting period."
96,97,"internal risk transfer as per osfi capital adequacy requirements (car),",t51 market risk measures,risk_management,"internal risk transfer as per osfi capital adequacy requirements (car), an internal risk transfer is defined as an internal record of a transfer of risk within the banking or trading book, or between the banking and trading book. in certain cases, it is more efficient for the bank to hedge a banking book’s interest rate risk exposure through an internal risk transfer to a trading desk which can externalize the risk to the market. this activity is governed by regulatory defined parameters to ensure the market risk is externalized. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk in the bank’s unhedged funding and investment activities arises primarily from the bank’s net investments in foreign operations as well as foreign currency earnings in its domestic and remitting foreign branch operations. the bank’s foreign currency exposure to its net investments in foreign operations is controlled by a board-approved limit. this limit considers factors such as potential volatility to shareholders’ equity as well as the potential impact on capital ratios from foreign exchange fluctuations. on a monthly basis, the asset-liability committee reviews the bank’s foreign currency net investment exposures and determines the appropriate hedging strategies. these may include funding the investments in the same currency or using other financial instruments, including derivatives. foreign currency translation gains and losses from net investments in foreign operations, net of related hedging activities and tax effects, are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity. however, the bank’s regulatory capital ratios are not materially affected by these foreign exchange fluctuations because the risk-weighted assets of the foreign operations tend to move in a similar direction. the bank is also subject to foreign currency translation risk on the earnings of its domestic and remitting foreign branch operations. the bank forecasts foreign currency revenues and expenses, over a number of future fiscal quarters. the asset-liability committee also assesses economic data trends and forecasts to determine if some or all of the estimated future foreign currency revenues and expenses should be hedged. hedging instruments normally include foreign currency spot and forward contracts, as well as foreign currency options and swaps. certain of these economic hedges may not qualify for hedge accounting resulting in a potential for a mismatch in the timing of the recognition of economic hedge gains/losses and the underlying foreign earnings translation gains/losses. in accordance with ifrs, foreign currency translation gains and losses relating to monetary and non-monetary items are recorded directly in earnings. as at october 31, 2024, a one percent increase (decrease) in the canadian dollar against all currencies in which the bank operates decreases (increases) the bank’s before-tax annual earnings by approximately $45 million (october 31, 2023 – $63 million) in the absence of hedging activity, due primarily from exposure to u.s. dollars from the bank’s operations in the u.s. and activities conducted internationally in this currency and from exposures to latin american currencies. investment portfolio risks the bank holds investment portfolios to meet liquidity and statutory reserve requirements and for investment purposes. these portfolios expose the bank to interest rate, foreign currency, credit spread and equity risks. debt investments primarily consist of government, agency, and corporate 94 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
bonds. equity investments include common and preferred shares, as well as a diversified portfolio of third-party managed funds. the majority of these securities are valued using prices obtained from external sources. these portfolios are controlled by a board-approved policy and limits. trading market risk the bank’s policies, processes and controls for trading activities are designed to achieve a balance between pursuing profitable trading opportunities and managing earnings volatility within a framework of sound and prudent practices. trading activities are primarily customer focused. the designation of an instrument as a trading instrument is determined by the bank’s market risk management policies. osfi’ capital adequacy requirements (car) guideline prescribes a list of instrument types which are presumed to be part of a bank’s trading portfolio. to assign these instruments to the banking book, certain criteria must be met including osfi’s approval. the bank’s list of these instruments include equity positions which are outside of the trading business and primarily held for investment, membership in exchanges or to manage the stock-based compensation program. there are also fixed income positions which include positions held for liquidity or regulatory purposes, positions within wealth management and loans held as available for sale. as of october 31, 2024, the market value of the instruments mentioned above is $1,480 million in total. there has been no case where instruments have been moved between the trading and banking book since the last reporting period. market risk arising from the bank’s trading activities is managed in accordance with board-approved policies, and aggregate var and stress testing limits. the quality of the bank’s var is validated by regular backtesting analysis, in which the var is compared to both theoretical profit and loss results based on fixed end of day positions and actual reported profit and loss. a var at the 99% confidence interval is an indication of a 1% probability that losses will exceed the var if positions remain unchanged during the next business day. trading positions are however managed dynamically and, as a result, actual profit/loss backtesting exceptions are uncommon. aging reports are used to monitor the frequency of turnover of trading portfolio inventory. value at risk (var) is a key measure of market risk in the bank’s trading activities. as a result of the implementation of the fundamental review of the trading book (frtb) in q1 2024, var, stressed var (svar) and the incremental risk charge (irc) are no longer components of market risk capital. var remains a primary measure of market risk, with additional portfolios included in the calculation. prior period has been revised to conform to the current calculation of var. in fiscal 2024, the total var for trading activities averaged $14.9 million, compared to $16.4 million in 2023. the change was mainly driven by lower combined credit spread and interest rate risk as well as commodity exposure."

100,101,liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk,t53 liquid asset pool,risk_management,"liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the bank is unable to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner at reasonable prices. financial obligations include liabilities to depositors, payments due under derivative contracts, settlement of securities borrowing and repurchase transactions, and lending and investment commitments. effective liquidity risk management is essential to maintain the confidence of depositors and counterparties, manage the bank’s cost of funds and to support core business activities, even under adverse circumstances. liquidity risk is managed within the framework of policies and limits that are approved by the board of directors. the board receives reports on risk exposures and performance against approved limits. the asset-liability committee (alco) provides senior management oversight of liquidity risk. the key elements of the liquidity risk framework are: • measurement and modeling – the bank’s liquidity model measures and forecasts cash inflows and outflows, including off-balance sheet cash flows on a daily basis. risk is managed by a set of key limits over the maximum net cash outflow by currency over specified short-term horizons (cash gaps), a minimum level of core liquidity, and liquidity stress tests. • reporting – global risk management provides independent oversight of all significant liquidity risks, supporting the alco with analysis, risk measurement, stress testing, monitoring and reporting. • stress testing – the bank performs liquidity stress testing on a regular basis, to evaluate the effect of both industry-wide and bank-specific disruptions on the bank’s liquidity position. liquidity stress testing has many purposes including: – helping the bank understand the potential behavior of various on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions in circumstances of stress; and – based on this knowledge, facilitating the development of risk mitigation and contingency plans. the bank’s liquidity stress tests consider the effect of changes in funding assumptions, depositor behavior and the market value of liquid assets. the bank performs industry standard stress tests, the results of which are reviewed at senior levels of the organization and are considered in making liquidity management decisions. • contingency planning – the bank maintains a liquidity contingency plan that specifies an approach for analyzing and responding to actual and potential liquidity events. the plan outlines an appropriate governance structure for the management and monitoring of liquidity events, processes for effective internal and external communication, and identifies potential counter measures to be considered at various stages of an event. a contingency plan is maintained both at the parent-level as well as for major subsidiaries. • funding diversification – the bank actively manages the diversification of its deposit liabilities by source, type of depositor, instrument, term and geography. • core liquidity – the bank maintains a pool of highly liquid, unencumbered assets that can be readily sold or pledged to secure borrowings under stressed market conditions or due to bank-specific events. the bank also maintains liquid assets to support its intra-day settlement obligations in payment, depository and clearing systems. liquid assets liquid assets are a key component of liquidity management and the bank holds these types of assets in sufficient quantity to meet potential needs for liquidity management. liquid assets can be used to generate cash either through sale, repurchase transactions or other transactions where these assets can be used as collateral to generate cash, or by allowing the asset to mature. liquid assets include deposits at central banks, deposits with financial institutions, call and other short-term loans, marketable securities, precious metals and securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions. liquid assets do not include borrowing capacity from central bank facilities. marketable securities are securities traded in active markets, which can be converted to cash within a timeframe that is in accordance with the bank’s liquidity management framework. assets are assessed considering a number of factors, including the expected time it would take to convert them to cash. marketable securities included in liquid assets are comprised of securities specifically held as a liquidity buffer or for asset liability management purposes; trading securities, which are primarily held by global banking and markets; and collateral received for securities financing and derivative transactions. 98 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
the bank maintains large holdings of unencumbered liquid assets to support its operations. these assets generally can be sold or pledged to meet the bank’s obligations. as at october 31, 2024, unencumbered liquid assets were $310 billion (october 31, 2023 – $319 billion). securities, including national housing act (nha) mortgage-backed securities, comprised 81% of liquid assets (october 31, 2023 – 73%). other unencumbered liquid assets, comprising cash and deposits with central banks, deposits with financial institutions and precious metals, were 19% (october 31, 2023 – 27%). the decrease in total unencumbered liquid assets was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and deposits with central banks, partly offset by an increase in nha mortgage-backed securities, precious metals and other liquid securities. the carrying values outlined in the liquid asset table are consistent with the carrying values in the bank’s consolidated statement of financial position as at october 31, 2024. the liquidity value of the portfolio will vary under different stress events as different assumptions are used for the stress scenarios. the bank’s liquid asset pool is summarized in the following table:"

105,106,available stable funding (asf) is primarily provided by the bank’s large,t58 wholesale funding,risk_management,"available stable funding (asf) is primarily provided by the bank’s large pool of retail, small business and corporate customer deposits; secured and unsecured wholesale funding and capital. required stable funding (rsf) primarily originates from the bank’s loan and mortgage portfolio, securities holdings, off-balance sheet items and other assets. the bank’s nsfr as at october 31, 2024 was higher than the previous year due to a combination of higher asf and lower rsf. higher asf from retail deposits and deposits from small business customers were partly offset by lower asf from wholesale funding. lower rsf from performing loans were partly offset by higher rsf from high quality liquid assets and other assets. funding the bank ensures that its funding sources are well diversified. funding concentrations are regularly monitored and analyzed by type. the sources of funding are capital, deposits from retail and commercial clients sourced through the canadian and international branch network, deposits from financial institutions as well as wholesale debt issuances. capital and personal deposits are key components of the bank’s funding and these amounted to $398 billion as at october 31, 2024 (october 31, 2023 – $385 billion). the increase since october 31, 2023 is due to growth of $10 billion in personal deposits and common equity of $3 billion from earnings and the impact of the shareholder dividend and share purchase plan. the bank’s funding is also comprised of commercial deposits, particularly those of an operating or relationship nature. capital and customer deposit based funding is augmented by wholesale debt issuances, the longer term (original maturity over 1 year) portion of which amounts to $206 billion (october 31, 2023 – $216 billion). longer term wholesale debt issuances include senior notes, mortgage securitizations, asset-backed securities and covered bonds. the bank operates in many different currencies and countries. from a funding perspective, the most significant currencies are canadian and u.s. dollars. with respect to the bank’s operations outside canada, there are different funding strategies depending on the nature of the activities in each country. for those countries where the bank operates a branch banking subsidiary, the strategy is for the subsidiary to be substantially self-funding in its local market. for other subsidiaries or branches outside canada where local deposit gathering capability is not sufficient, funding is provided through the wholesale funding activities of the bank. from an overall funding perspective, the bank’s objective is to achieve an appropriate balance between the cost and the stability of funding. diversification of funding sources is a key element of the funding strategy. the bank’s wholesale debt diversification strategy is primarily executed via the bank’s main wholesale funding centres, located in toronto, new york, london and singapore. the majority of these funds are sourced in canadian and u.s. dollars. where required, these funds are swapped to fund assets in different currencies. the funding strategy deployed by wholesale funding centres and the management of associated risks, such as geographic and currency risk, are managed centrally within the framework of policies and limits that are approved by the board of directors. in the normal course, the bank uses a mix of unsecured and secured wholesale funding instruments across a variety of markets. the choice of instruments and markets is based on a number of factors, including relative cost, market capacity and diversification of funding. market conditions can change over time, impacting cost and capacity in particular markets or instruments. changing market conditions can include periods of stress where the availability of funding in particular markets or instruments is constrained. in these circumstances, the bank would increase its focus on sources of funding in functioning markets and secured funding instruments. should a period of extreme stress exist such that all wholesale funding sources are constrained, the bank maintains a pool of liquid assets to mitigate its liquidity risk. this pool includes cash, deposits with central banks and securities. in canada, the bank raises short and longer-term wholesale debt through the issuance of senior unsecured notes. additional longer-term wholesale debt may be generated through the bank’s canadian debt and equity shelf, the securitization of canadian insured residential mortgages through cmhc programs (such as canada mortgage bonds), uninsured residential mortgages through the bank’s covered bond program, retail credit card receivables through the trillium credit card trust ii program, retail indirect auto loan receivables through the securitized term auto receivables trust program and unsecured personal lines of credit through the halifax receivables trust program. cmhc securitization programs, while included in the bank’s view of wholesale debt issuance, do not entail the run-off risk that can be experienced in funding raised from capital markets. outside of canada, short-term wholesale debt may be raised through the issuance of negotiable certificates of deposit in the united states, hong kong, the united kingdom, and australia and the issuance of commercial paper in the united states. the bank operates longer-term wholesale debt issuance registered programs in the united states, such as its sec registered debt and equity shelf, and non-registered programs, such as the securitization of retail indirect auto loan receivables

106,107,wholesale funding generally bears a higher risk of run-off,t59 contractual maturities,risk_management,"wholesale funding generally bears a higher risk of run-off in a stressed environment than other sources of funding. the bank mitigates this risk through funding diversification, ongoing engagement with investors and by maintaining a large holding of unencumbered liquid assets. unencumbered liquid assets of $310 billion as at october 31, 2024 (october 31, 2023 – $319 billion) were well in excess of wholesale funding sources that mature in the next twelve months. contractual maturities and obligations the table below provides the maturity of assets and liabilities as well as the off-balance sheet commitments as at october 31, 2024, based on the contractual maturity date. from a liquidity risk perspective the bank considers factors other than contractual maturity in the assessment of liquid assets or in determining expected future cash flows. in particular, for securities with a fixed maturity date, the ability and time horizon to raise cash from these securities is more relevant to liquidity management than contractual maturity. for other assets and deposits the bank uses assumptions about rollover rates to assess liquidity risk for normal course and stress scenarios. similarly, the bank uses assumptions to assess the potential drawdown of credit commitments in various scenarios. the bank’s contractual obligations include contracts and purchase obligations, including agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable, legally binding on the bank and affect the bank’s liquidity and capital resource needs. the bank leases a large number of its branches, offices and other locations. the majority of these leases are for a term of five years, with options to renew. 104 | 2024 scotiabank annual report"
109,113,"principal risks – non-financial money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risk",controls and accounting policies controls and procedures,risk_management,"principal risks – non-financial money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risk money laundering / terrorist financing (ml/tf) and sanctions risks are the susceptibility of scotiabank to be used by individuals or organizations to launder the proceeds of crime, finance terrorism, or violate economic sanctions. it also includes the risk that scotiabank does not comply with applicable anti-money laundering (aml)/anti-terrorist financing (atf) or sanctions legislation or does not apply adequate controls reasonably designed to deter and detect ml/tf and sanctions violations or to file required regulatory reports. money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risks are managed throughout the bank via the operation of the bank’s aml/atf and sanctions program (“the aml/atf program”). the group chief anti-money laundering officer is responsible for the aml/atf program, which includes the development and application of compliance policies, procedures, the assessment of money laundering, terrorist-financing and sanctions risks, and the maintenance of an ongoing training program. the effectiveness of the aml/atf and sanctions program is subject to regular review and independent assessment conducted by the audit department. global compliance & aml establishes enterprise standards to assess clients for money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risk. the bank conducts an enterprise-wide annual self-assessment of the money laundering/terrorist financing (ml/tf) and sanctions risks inherent in its business units, as well as an assessment of the control measures in place to manage those risks. the process is led by global compliance & aml, the results of which are shared with the bank’s senior management. all active employees are provided with mandatory aml/atf and sanctions training on an annual basis. the bank performs client due diligence sufficient to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its clients, including in the case of an entity, its material ultimate beneficial owners. the bank will not maintain anonymous accounts, nor will it maintain accounts for shell banks. consistent with a risk-based approach, the bank assesses the risks of its clients and, where appropriate, conducts enhanced due diligence on those who are considered higher risk. the bank also conducts ongoing risk tailored monitoring of its clients to detect and report suspicious transactions and activity, and conducts client and transaction screening against terrorist, sanctions, and other designated watch-lists. operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from people, inadequate processes and systems, or from external events. operational risk includes third party risk, fraud risk and legal risk. it exists in some form in each of the bank’s business and support activities, and third parties with whom the bank has entered a business or strategic arrangement for outsourcing activities, the provision of products or services, or other benefits. it can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and damage to the bank’s reputation. operational risk management refers to the discipline of systematic identification, assessment, measurement, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of operational risk. the bank’s operational risk management framework (ormf) outlines a structured approach for the effective management of enterprise-wide operational risk in a manner consistent with best practices and regulatory requirements. the ormf is supplemented by additional policies, processes, standards and methodologies. the ormf supports the governance and management of all other non-financial risks. the framework is approved by the bank’s operational risk committee and addresses program governance, risk culture and risk appetite along with the following key program components: risk identification and assessment risk identification and assessment is a critical part of effectively managing operational risk. risks are identified, classified and assessed. their potential impact is evaluated and reported to management and the board. operational risk management tools and programs are in place to support the identification and assessment of operational risk with each having their defined methodology and/or standards. the key tools include risk and control self-assessment (rcsa), scenario analysis, and new initiatives risk assessment (nira). risk measurement a key component of risk management is quantifying the size and scope of the bank’s operational risk exposure. the collection and analysis of operational risk event data and operational risk capital values provide meaningful information to measure operational risk. the data provides meaningful information for assessing and mitigating operational risk exposure at the bank as a result of event root cause analysis and evaluation of internal controls. timely, accurate and complete reporting of internal operational risk events, and their analyses, ensures that the bank maintains a strong risk culture, promotes transparency, and enables the following: • monitoring risk exposure, and to assess if the bank is operating within risk appetite. • contributes to the assessment of the effectiveness of the operational control environment. • causal analysis to identify deficiencies and control failures that can be mitigated to prevent recurrence of future events. • compliance with basel iii standardized approach (sa) requirements for the calculation of operational risk capital. operational risk capital refers to regulatory and internal capital which is quantified as a reserve for unexpected losses resulting from operational risk. operational risk capital is a component of the total amount of risk capital that the bank holds. loss data from ores are collected in the bank’s operational risk management system (openpages) and used for reporting purposes. when combined with business indicator component (bic)1 data, the loss data captured from ores is a critical input for the calculation of the bank’s internal loss multiplier (ilm)2, which is included in the operational risk regulatory capital calculation. risk mitigation and control operational risk response decisions include mitigation, transfer, acceptance, and avoidance of operational risks. the appropriate response will be determined based on consideration of the nature of the risks, their potential impacts and the consideration of the bank’s code of conduct and risk appetite thresholds. through the bank’s operational risk management tools, issues such as deficiencies in the design or operating effectiveness of a control may be identified. when issues are identified, action plans can be developed to address them, or, where appropriate, the risk associated with these issues can be accepted. action plans are managed by action owners to ensure the detailed plans are executed timely and effectively. 1 business indicator component (bic) is calculated by multiplying the business indicator (bi) by set of regulatory determined marginal coefficients. the bi is a financial statement-based proxy for operational risk. 2 internal loss multiplier (ilm) is a scaling factor that is based on an institution’s average historical losses and the bic. management’s discussion and analysis | risk management 2024

management’s discussion and analysis controls are identified and assessed through the various operational risk management tools. in cases where controls are deemed deficient a response will be required which will in turn help to mitigate residual risk. risk monitoring, analytics, and reporting the bank has processes in place for the ongoing monitoring of operational risk. these monitoring activities can provide an early warning of emerging issues, triggering timely management response. in addition, these activities allow for review and analysis of the risk profile in relation to risk appetite or other key indicators to identify when potential risk events may be approaching or exceeding thresholds, requiring action and/or escalation. operational risk data is collected in risk systems and used for reporting. operational risk reporting facilitates distribution and escalation of operational risk information to the relevant parties, including the operational risk committee, as well as senior management and the board via the enterprise risk management report. it provides stakeholders involved in operational risk management activities access to reliable data in a consistent and timely manner to support risk-based decision making. cyber security and information technology (it) risk cyber security risk is the risk of loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information, data, or information systems and reflect the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, or reputation) and assets, customers, and other stakeholders. information technology risk is the risk of financial loss, disruption or damage to reputation from a failure of information technology systems. the cyber security and it risk landscape continues to evolve across the financial industry. the increasing use of digital delivery channels to deliver financial services exposes the bank to various vectors of attack. threat actors, including individuals, organized crime rings and nation state sponsored entities, continue to target financial institutions to steal data, money or to disrupt operations. these events can adversely impact the bank’s operational environment, our customers and other third parties. the board of directors approves the information technology and information security risk summary framework, which along with its respective policies and other frameworks are focused on safeguarding the bank and its customers’ information, ensuring the bank’s it environment is secure and resilient in support of our business objectives. the bank continues to expand its cyber security capabilities to defend against potential threats and minimize impact to the business. compliance risk compliance risk is the risk of an activity not being conducted in conformity with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and prescribed practices (“regulatory requirements”), and compliance-related internal policies and procedures and ethical standards expected by regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders. compliance risk includes regulatory compliance risk, conduct risk, and privacy risk. regulatory compliance risk: the risk that business activity may not be conducted in conformity with all applicable regulatory requirements wherever the bank does business. conduct risk: an aggregation of risks arising from actions or behaviours of the bank’s officers, directors, employees, or the conduct of the bank’s business (directly or indirectly), not in conformity with the bank’s values or principles for ethical conduct and which has, or has the potential to have, an adverse impact on the bank, the bank’s customers or employees, or integrity of the financial markets in which the bank operates. privacy risk: the risk that arises from contraventions of applicable privacy laws, regulations, standards, and regulatory expectations; ethical or operational standards set out in the scotiabank code of conduct (our ‘code’), or other bank policies, procedures, manuals, guidelines; and/or employees’ responsibility to respectfully treat the personally identifiable information (pii) of the bank’s customers, employees, and other stakeholders. the board approves the compliance risk summary framework which provides an overview of the key governance components, responsibilities and programs which support the bank in effectively managing compliance risk as a part of the bank’s compliance program. the bank is required to comply with e-13 guidelines as set out by the office of the superintendent of financial institution (osfi) with respect to the management of regulatory compliance risk. regulatory compliance management at the bank is governed by the compliance management framework (cmf). the primary objective of the bank’s cmf is to provide assurance that the bank’s business activities are being conducted in a manner compliant with all applicable regulations in the bank’s countries of operations and in line with the bank’s risk appetite. environmental, social and governance risk esg risk is the risk that an environmental (including climate risk), social, or governance event, or condition, which if occurs could cause an actual or potential negative impact to the bank. the bank considers environmental risk to be the potential adverse impacts to the bank because of climate change and/or damage to the natural environment or biodiversity, such as land, water, plants, natural resources, ecosystems, and the atmosphere. the physical and transition risks associated with climate change are a component of environmental risk. social risk is the risk of potential adverse impacts to the bank that can arise due to the mismanagement of social considerations that can cause actual or perceived negative impacts on people and communities. social considerations include, but are not limited to, human rights (including human trafficking and modern slavery); indigenous rights; labour standards and working conditions; diversity, equity, and inclusion; accessibility; community health, safety, and security; disadvantaged and vulnerable groups; cultural property and heritage; and land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. corporate governance refers to the oversight mechanisms and the way in which the bank is governed. it encompasses the bank’s policies and processes, how decisions are made, and how it deals with the various interests of, and relationships with, its many stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, employees, regulators, and the broader community. governance risk is the risk of potential adverse impacts to the bank stemming from poor or ineffective corporate governance mechanisms and controls. governance board oversight the board of directors and its committees provide oversight of esg risk to ensure alignment with the bank’s strategies and risk appetite. it also approves key risk policies, frameworks and limits. the following board committees provide ongoing oversight: • risk committee: retains oversight of esg risks, including climate-related risks, and periodically reviews and approves the bank’s key risk management policies, frameworks, and limits to ensure that management is operating within the bank’s enterprise risk appetite framework. 108 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
• corporate governance committee: evaluates the bank’s environmental and social performance and assesses best practices for esg disclosure; examines current and emerging esg topics, considers their implications on the bank’s strategy and reviews the bank’s annual esg report; and acts in an advisory capacity through a continuing assessment of the bank’s approach to corporate governance and makes policy recommendations, including on topics such as human rights. • audit & conduct review committee: oversees climate-related disclosure as part of the bank’s financial reporting, sets standards of conduct for ethical behaviour and oversees conduct risk management, and consumer protection. • human capital & compensation committee: oversees human capital and compensation strategies related to diversity, equity and inclusion, employee health, safety, and well-being and other esg policies and practices. management’s role the board of directors is supported by the president and chief executive officer (ceo) and chief risk officer (cro). the cro has delegated their authority over the oversight of esg risk to the operational risk committee (orc). the orc provides effective oversight and challenge of the bank’s management of environmental and social risks. its responsibilities include monitoring of the esg risk profile, reviewing and approving esg risk frameworks, policies, risk appetite statements and limits. the bank actively monitors policy and legislative requirements through ongoing dialogue with government, industry, and stakeholders in the countries where it operates. scotiabank regularly meets with various external stakeholders, including industry associations, with respect to roles that banks can play on esg related issues and to share best practices. risk management the bank’s approach for the effective management of esg risk is governed by our esg risk management framework in a manner consistent with the enterprise-wide risk management framework. the esg risk management framework describes the guiding principles, program elements, and roles and responsibilities relating to the bank’s management of esg risk and establishes the minimum requirements for the integration of esg risk considerations into the decision-making processes across other risk types and business strategies, activities and internal operations. this framework assists the bank as we continue to advance our capabilities in managing esg risks in a manner that is consistent with regulatory requirements, industry standards, best practices, and risk appetite. the esg risk management framework is supported by additional policies, processes, and guidelines, designed to help mitigate esg risk or advance responsible practices. for example, scotiabank is a signatory to the equator principles (eps) framework, which enables the bank, in partnership with our clients, to identify, assess, manage and report environmental and social risks and impacts associated with the large-scale infrastructure and industrial development projects. we also have policies in place related to our financing activities to oil and gas projects in the arctic circle, and to projects related to thermal coal mining and power, unesco world heritage sites and wetlands of international importance, and illegal logging and wildlife trade. our approach to respecting and promoting human rights is communicated in the scotiabank code of conduct and in the global human rights statement. the bank has set a number of enterprise-wide commitments that aim to address climate-related risks and opportunities in the short, medium, and long term. scotiabank is a member of the net zero banking alliance (nzba), re-enforcing the bank’s commitment in playing a significant role to finance the climate transition to reach the goal of net-zero by 2050. as a member of the nzba, we have committed to setting and disclosing interim emissions reduction targets for certain high-emitting sectors. the bank has also committed to provide $350 billion by 2030 in climate- related finance to support clients in their strategies to address climate change and other environmental goals. our climate related finance framework outlines the financial product and services we offer in support of these objectives. additional information on the bank’s approach to climate change risk management and strategy will be provided in our 2024 climate report. data risk data risk is the risk of exposure to the adverse financial and non-financial consequences (e.g., revenue loss, reputational risk, regulatory risk, sub-optimal management decisions) caused by mismanagement, misunderstanding or misuse of the bank’s data assets. this risk may arise from poor data quality; inadequate data management or data architecture; and/or unethical data usage. the data risk management framework (drmf) outlines the overarching guiding principles for data risk management and defines the governance structure of the enterprise data risk management program, recognizing the collaborative nature of data risk management and oversight. the data risk management policy (drmp) categorizes and explains risks associated with data, and outlines the interaction model and roles and responsibilities for key stakeholders involved in managing data risk across the organization. model risk model risk is the risk of adverse financial (e.g., capital, losses, revenue) and reputational consequences arising from the design, development, implementation and/or use of a model. it can originate from, among other things, inappropriate specifications; incorrect parameter estimates; flawed hypotheses and/or assumptions; mathematical computation errors; inaccurate, inappropriate or incomplete data; inappropriate, improper or unintended usage; and inadequate monitoring and/or controls. the model risk management framework outlines the bank’s approach for effective governance and oversight of model risk consistent with the policies and processes outlined in the bank’s model risk management policy (mrmp). the mrmp describes the overarching principles, policies, and procedures that provide the framework for managing model risk. all models, whether developed by the bank or vendor-supplied, that meet the bank’s model definition are covered by this policy. the mrmp also clearly defines roles and responsibilities for key stakeholders involved in the model risk management cycle. reputational risk reputational risk is the risk that negative publicity or stakeholder sentiment regarding scotiabank’s conduct, business practices or associations, whether true or not, will adversely affect its revenues, operations or customer base, or require costly litigation or other defensive measures. management’s discussion and analysis | risk management the bank has an enterprise reputational risk policy, as well as other policies and procedures for managing suitability risk, and reputational and legal risk related to various transactions, relationships or other bank activities. reputational risk is managed and controlled by the scotiabank code 2024 scotiabank annual report | 109
management’s discussion and analysis of conduct, governance practices and risk management programs, policies, procedures, and training. all directors, officers and employees have a responsibility to conduct their activities in accordance with the scotiabank code of conduct, and in a manner that minimizes reputational risk. the activities of the legal; global tax; corporate secretary; global communications; global compliance & aml, and global risk management departments, as well as the reputational risk committee, are particularly oriented to the management of reputational risk. strategic risk strategic risk is the risk that the enterprise, business lines or corporate functions will make strategic choices that are inappropriate or insufficiently resilient to changes in the business environment, or ineffectively execute such strategies. the board is ultimately responsible for oversight of strategic risk, by ensuring a robust strategic planning process and approving, on an annual basis, the strategic plan for the bank. changes in our business strategy can impact our risk appetite and therefore the annual strategy report to the board of directors considers linkages between the bank’s enterprise risk appetite framework and the enterprise strategy, business line strategies and how the corporate functions support the business lines in the execution of their strategic plans. the board reviews this material, along with other relevant strategic and financial presentations by management throughout the year in order to provide the appropriate governance. the strategic planning process is managed by enterprise strategy which supports the management of strategic risk throughout the planning process by ensuring alignment across our business, financial, capital and risk planning. global risk management also provides oversight of strategic risk by providing independent reviews throughout the strategic planning process, establishing enterprise risk frameworks, and independently monitoring and reporting on the level of risk established against our risk appetite metrics. the development, evaluation and execution of the bank’s strategic plans is owned by the management team of the bank. they participate actively in the annual planning process and on an ongoing basis, heads of business lines and corporate functions identify, manage, and assess the internal and external risks that could impede achievement of, or progress of, strategic objectives. the executive management team regularly meets to evaluate the effectiveness of the bank’s strategic plan, and consider what amendments, if any, are required. 110 | 2024 scotiabank annual report"

113,117,critical accounting policies and estimates the bank’s accounting policies are integral,future accounting developments the bank actively monitors developments and changes,controls_acounting,"critical accounting policies and estimates the bank’s accounting policies are integral to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported in this annual report. note 3 to the consolidated financial statements summarizes the material accounting policies used in preparing the bank’s consolidated financial statements. certain of these policies require management to make estimates, assumptions and subjective judgments that are difficult, complex, and often relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. the policies discussed below are particularly important to the presentation of the bank’s financial position and results of operations, as changes in the estimates, assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the bank’s consolidated financial statements. these estimates, assumptions and judgments are adjusted in the normal course of business to reflect changing underlying circumstances. allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses, using an expected credit loss approach as required under ifrs 9, is estimated using valuation models and incorporates inputs, assumptions and techniques that involve a high degree of management judgment. under ifrs 9 expected credit loss methodology, an allowance is recorded for expected credit losses on financial assets regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. the bank recognizes an allowance at an amount equal to 12 month expected credit losses if the credit risk at the reporting date has not increased significantly since initial recognition (stage 1). when a financial asset experiences a significant increase in credit risk after origination but is not considered to be in default, it is included in stage 2 and subject to lifetime expected credit losses. financial assets that are in default are included in stage 3. similar to stage 2, the allowance for credit losses for stage 3 financial assets captures the lifetime expected credit losses. the main drivers in allowance for credit loss changes that are subject to significant judgment include the following: • determination of point-in-time parameters such as probability of default (pd), loss given default (lgd) and exposure at default (ead). • forecast of macroeconomic variables for multiple scenarios and probability weighting of the scenarios. • assessment of significant increase in credit risk. qualitative adjustments or overlays may also be made as temporary adjustments using expert credit judgment in circumstances where, in the bank’s view, the existing regulatory guidance, inputs, assumptions, and/or modelling techniques do not capture all relevant risk factors. the use of management overlays requires significant judgment that may impact the amount of allowance recognized. measurement of expected credit losses the probability of default (pd), exposure at default (ead), and loss given default (lgd) inputs used to estimate expected credit losses are modelled based on historical default and loss experience, and macroeconomic variables that are closely related with credit losses in the relevant portfolio. management’s discussion and analysis | controls and accounting policies 2024 scotiabank annual report | 111
management’s discussion and analysis details of these statistical parameters/inputs are as follows: • pd – the probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. a default may only happen at a certain time over the remaining estimated life, if the facility has not been previously derecognized and is still in the portfolio. • ead – the exposure at default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments. • lgd – the loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. it is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realization of any collateral. it is usually expressed as a percentage of the ead. forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios the bank uses a broad range of forward-looking economic information as inputs to its models of expected credit losses and the related allowance. these include real gdp, unemployment rates, consumer price index, central bank interest rates, and house-price indices, amongst others. the allowance is determined using four probability-weighted, forward-looking scenarios. the bank considers both internal and external sources of information and data in order to create unbiased projections and forecasts. the bank prepares the scenarios using forecasts generated by scotiabank economics (se). the forecasts are generated using both internally and externally developed models whose outputs are modified by se as necessary to formulate a ‘base case’ view of the most probable future direction of economic developments; se also develops a representative range of other alternative possible forecast scenarios. more specifically, the process involves the development of three additional economic scenarios to which relative probabilities are assigned. the development of the baseline and alternative scenarios is overseen by a governance committee that consists of internal stakeholders from across the bank. the final baseline and alternative scenarios reflect significant review and oversight and incorporate judgment both in the determination of the scenarios’ forecasts and the probability weights that are assigned to them. significant increase in credit risk (sir) the assessment of sir since origination of a financial asset considers borrower-specific quantitative and qualitative information without consideration of collateral, and the impact of forward-looking information. quantitative models may not always be able to capture all reasonable and supportable information that may indicate a significant increase in credit risk. qualitative factors may be assessed to supplement the gap. examples of situations include changes in adjudication criteria for a particular group of borrowers; changes in portfolio composition; and natural disaster events impacting certain portfolios. for retail exposures, a significant increase in credit risk is assessed based on thresholds that exist by product which consider the change in pd. the thresholds used for pd migration are reviewed and assessed at least annually unless there is a significant change in credit risk management practices in which case the review is brought forward. for non-retail exposures the bank uses an internal risk rating scale (ig codes). all non-retail exposures have an ig code assigned that reflects the probability of default of the borrower. both borrower specific and non-borrower specific (i.e. macroeconomic) forward-looking information is considered and reflected in the ig rating. significant increase in credit risk is evaluated based on the migration of the exposures among ig codes. fair value of financial instruments all financial instruments are measured at fair value on initial recognition. subsequent measurement of a financial instrument depends on its classification. the contractual cash flow characteristics of a financial instrument and the business model under which it is held determine such classification. non-trading loans and receivables, certain securities and most financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost unless classified or designated as fair value through profit and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income at inception. the fair value of a financial asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal, or in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the bank has access at the measurement date. the bank discloses the classification of all financial instruments carried at fair value in a hierarchy based on the determination of fair value. the best evidence of fair value for a financial instrument is the quoted price in an active market. fair value based on unadjusted quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets represents a level 1 valuation. quoted prices are not always available for over-the-counter (otc) transactions, as well as transactions in inactive or illiquid markets. otc transactions are valued using internal models that maximize the use of observable inputs to estimate fair value. the chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would consider in pricing a transaction. when fair value is based on all significant market observable inputs, the valuation is classified as level 2. financial instruments traded in a less active market can be valued using indicative market prices, the present value of cash flows or other valuation techniques. fair value estimates normally do not consider forced or liquidation sales. where financial instruments trade in inactive markets or when using models where observable parameters do not exist, significant management judgement is required for valuation methodologies and model inputs. valuations that require the significant use of unobservable inputs are considered level 3. the calculation of estimated fair value is based on market conditions at a specific point in time and therefore may not be reflective of future fair values. the bank has controls and processes in place to ensure that the valuation of financial instruments is appropriately determined. global risk management (grm) is responsible for the design and application of the bank’s risk management framework. grm is independent of the bank’s business units and is overseen by executive management and the board of directors. senior management committees within grm oversee and establish standards that are critical in ensuring that appropriate valuation methodologies and policies are in place for determining fair value. where possible, valuations are based on quoted prices or observable inputs obtained from active markets. grm oversees a monthly independent price verification (ipv) process to ensure the reliability and accuracy of prices and inputs used in the determination of fair value. the ipv process is performed by price verification groups that are independent of the business. the bank maintains an approved list of pricing sources that are used in the ipv process. these sources include, but are not limited to, brokers, dealers and consensus pricing services. the valuation policies relating to the ipv process require that all pricing or rate sources be external to the bank. at least annually, an independent assessment of pricing or rate sources is performed by grm to determine the market presence or market representative levels. where quoted prices are not readily available, such as for transactions in over-the-counter markets, internal models that maximize the use of observable inputs are used to estimate fair value. an independent second-line model risk management function within grm oversees the initial 112 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
model validation, approval and ongoing validation and the performance monitoring of valuation models used in determining fair value. model development and validation processes are governed by the bank’s model risk management policy. in determining fair value for certain instruments or portfolios of instruments, valuation adjustments or reserves may be required to arrive at a more accurate representation of fair value. the bank’s policy of applying valuation reserves to a portfolio of instruments is approved by a senior management committee. these reserves can include adjustments for credit risk, bid-offer spreads, unobservable parameters, funding costs and constraints on prices in inactive or illiquid markets. the methodology for the calculation of valuation reserves is reviewed at least annually by senior management. valuation adjustments recorded against the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities totaled $81 million as at october 31, 2024 (2023 – $153 million), net of any write-offs. the majority of the year-over-year change is due to tightening of counterparty credit spreads during the year. as at october 31, 2024, a net funding valuation adjustment (fva) representing an excess of funding benefit adjustment over funding cost adjustment of $165 million (2023 – $271 million), pre-tax, was recorded for uncollateralized derivative instruments. employee benefits the bank provides pension and other benefit plans for eligible employees in canada and internationally. pension benefits are offered in the form of defined benefit pension plans (generally based on an employee’s length of service and earnings) and defined contribution pension plans (where the bank’s contribution is fixed and there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts). other benefits include post-retirement health care, dental care and life insurance, along with other long-term employee benefits, such as long-term disability benefits. the employee benefit expenses and related benefit obligation are calculated using actuarial methods and certain actuarial assumptions. these assumptions are based on management’s best estimate and are reviewed and approved annually. the most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation, which is set by reference to the yields on high quality corporate bonds that have durations that match the terms of the bank’s obligations. separate discount rates are used to determine the annual benefit expense in canada and the u.s. these rates are determined with reference to the yields on high quality corporate bonds with durations that match the various components of the annual benefit expense. the discount rate used to determine the annual benefit expense for all other plans is the same as the rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation. other key assumptions include future compensation, health care costs, employee turnover, retirement age and mortality. when making these estimates, management considers expectations of future economic trends and business conditions, including inflation rates, as well as other factors, such as plan-specific experience and best practices. actual experience that differs from assumptions made by management will result in a net actuarial gain or loss recognized immediately in other comprehensive income, except for other long-term employee benefits, where they are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. note 29 of the consolidated financial statements contains details of the bank’s employee benefit plans, such as the disclosure of pension and other benefit amounts, management’s key assumptions, and a sensitivity analysis of changes in these assumptions on the employee benefit obligation and expense. corporate income taxes management exercises judgment in determining the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. the provision is based on management’s expectations regarding the income tax consequences of transactions and events during the period. management interprets the tax legislation for each jurisdiction in which the bank operates and makes assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. if management’s interpretations of the legislation differ from those of the tax authorities, or if the actual timing of the reversals of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities is not as anticipated, the provision for income taxes could increase or decrease in future periods. the bank maintains provisions for uncertain tax positions that it believes appropriately reflect the risk of tax positions under discussion, audit, dispute or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. these provisions are made using the bank’s best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on an assessment of all relevant factors, which are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. it is possible that additional liability and income tax expense could arise in the future, depending on the acceptance of the bank’s tax positions by the relevant tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which the bank operates. note 28 of the consolidated financial statements contains further details with respect to the bank’s provisions for income taxes. structured entities in the normal course of business, the bank enters arrangements with structured entities on behalf of its customers and for its own purposes. these structured entities can be generally categorized as multi-seller commercial paper conduits, bank funding vehicles and structured finance entities. further details are provided in the off-balance sheet arrangements section on page 68. management is required to exercise judgement to determine whether a structured entity should be consolidated. this evaluation involves understanding the arrangements, determining whether decisions about the relevant activities are made by means of voting rights or other contractual arrangements, and determining whether the bank controls the structured entity. the bank controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. the three elements of control are: • power over the investee; • exposure, or rights, to variable returns from involvement with the investee; and • the ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of the bank’s returns. this definition of control applies to circumstances: • when voting rights or similar rights give the bank power, including situations where the bank holds less than a majority of voting rights or involving potential voting rights; • when an investee is designed so that voting rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the investee (i.e., relevant activities are directed by contractual arrangements); • involving agency relationships; and • when the bank has control over specified assets of an investee. management’s discussion and analysis | controls and accounting policies 2024 scotiabank annual report | 113
management’s discussion and analysis the bank does not control an investee when it is acting in an agent’s capacity. the bank assesses whether it is an agent by determining whether it is primarily engaged to act on behalf and for the benefit of another party or parties. factors that the bank considers in this assessment include the scope of its decision-making authority over the investee, the rights held by other parties, the remuneration to which it is entitled, and the bank’s exposure to variability of returns from other interests that it holds in the investee. the analysis uses both qualitative and quantitative analytical techniques and involves the use of a number of assumptions about the business environment in which the structured entity operates and the amount and timing of future cash flows. the bank reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the three elements of control change. management is required to exercise judgement to determine if a change in control event has occurred. during 2024, there were no change in control events that caused the bank to change its control conclusion of its multi-seller conduits or other structured entities. as described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and in the discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements, the bank does not control the two canadian-based multi-seller conduits that it sponsors and they are not required to be consolidated on the bank’s consolidated statement of financial position. the bank controls its u.s.-based multi-seller conduit and consolidates it on the bank’s consolidated statement of financial position. goodwill for impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, on the acquisition date, allocated to each of the bank’s group of cash- generating units (cgu) that are expected to benefit from the particular acquisition. goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. at each reporting date, goodwill is reviewed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. each cgu to which goodwill is allocated for impairment testing reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. the bank determines the carrying value of the cgu using a regulatory capital approach based on credit, market, operational risks and leverage, consistent with the bank’s capital attribution for business line performance measurement. corporate capital that is not directly attributable is allocated to each cgu on a proportional basis. the recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs of disposal (fvlcd) and value in use (viu). if either fvlcd or viu exceeds the carrying amount, there is no need to determine the other. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the cgu exceeds the recoverable amount. an impairment loss, in respect of goodwill, is not reversed. fvlcd is the price that would be received from the sale of a cgu in an orderly transaction between market participants, less costs of disposal, at the measurement date. in determining fvlcd, an appropriate valuation model is used which considers various factors, including normalized net income, price earnings multiples, and control premiums. these calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples and quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators. viu is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from a cgu. the determination of viu involves judgment in estimating future cash flows, terminal growth rate and discount rate. the future cash flows are based on management approved budgets and plans which factor in market trends, macroeconomic conditions, forecasted earnings and business strategy for the cgu. the terminal growth rate is based on the long-term growth expectations in the relevant countries, while the discount rate is based on the cost of capital. significant judgment is applied in determining the recoverable amounts of the cgu and assessing whether certain events or circumstances constitute objective evidence of impairment. goodwill was assessed for annual impairment based on the methodology described above as at july 31, 2024, and no impairment was determined to exist. as of october 31, 2024, there were no significant changes to this assessment. for additional information, see note 19 of the consolidated financial statements. intangible assets intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset and are tested for impairment only when events and circumstances indicate impairment. indefinite life and finite life intangible assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. the recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs of disposal (fvlcd) and value in use (viu). if either fvlcd or viu exceeds the carrying amount, there is no need to determine the other. the viu method is used by the bank to determine the recoverable amount of intangible assets. in determining viu, a discounted cash flow valuation model is used which incorporates key assumptions, such as management-approved cash flow projections, terminal growth rate and the applicable discount rate. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount. impairment losses recognized in prior periods are reassessed at each reporting period for any indication that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. an impairment loss recognized in a prior period shall be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment was recognized. the reversal of an impairment loss reflects an increase in the estimated service potential of an asset, either from use or from sale, and does not only result from the passage of time. an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the intangible asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been recognized. the recoverable amount is significantly impacted by the discount rate and the terminal value. significant judgment is applied in determining the intangible asset’s recoverable amount and assessing whether certain events or circumstances constitute objective evidence of impairment. indefinite life intangible assets were assessed for annual impairment based on the methodology described above as at july 31, 2024, and no impairment was determined to exist. as of october 31, 2024, there were no significant changes to this assessment. for additional information on both indefinite life and finite life intangible assets, see note 19 of the consolidated financial statements. derecognition of financial assets financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset have expired, which occurs with repayment by the borrower or upon substantial modification of the asset terms. assets are also derecognized when the bank transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the financial asset or has assumed an obligation to pay those cash flows to an independent third-party, and the bank has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of that asset to an independent third-party. 114 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
management must apply judgement in determining whether a modification of the contractual terms of the financial asset is substantial. for loans, this includes the nature of the modification and the extent of changes to contractual terms including interest rate, authorized amount and term. management must also apply judgement in determining, based on specific facts and circumstances, whether the bank has retained or transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are neither retained nor transferred, the bank derecognizes the transferred asset only if it has lost control over that asset. if the bank retains control over the asset, it will continue to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. most assets transferred under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements, securitizations of fully insured canadian residential mortgages, and securitizations of credit card receivables do not qualify for derecognition. the bank continues to record the transferred assets on the consolidated statement of financial position as secured financings. further information on derecognition of financial assets can be found in note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. provisions the bank recognizes a provision if, because of a past event, the bank has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. probable in this context means more likely than not. significant judgement is required in determining whether a present obligation exists and in estimating the probability, timing, and amount of any future outflows. in the ordinary course of business, the bank and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in, or parties to a number of pending and threatened legal actions and regulatory proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, the bank cannot state what the eventual outcome of such matters will be. legal provisions are established when it becomes probable that the bank will incur an expense related to a legal action and the amount can be reliably estimated. such provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the amount required to settle any obligation related to these legal actions as at the balance sheet date, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. management and internal and external experts are involved in estimating any amounts that may be required. the actual costs of resolving these claims may vary significantly from the amount of the legal provisions. the bank’s estimate involves significant judgement, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the fact that the bank’s liability, if any, has yet to be determined and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. as such, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of those legal actions may be material to the bank’s consolidated results of operations for any reporting period. the bank, through its peruvian subsidiary, is engaged in legal actions related to certain value-added tax assessed amounts and associated interest totaling $176 million, which arose from certain client transactions that occurred prior to the bank’s acquisition of the subsidiary. the legal action in peru relating to the original assessed amount was heard by the peruvian constitutional court in june 2023. that case was decided in favour of the government of peru in may 2024. accordingly, the bank paid $34 million representing the principal and associated reasonable interest, which was recorded in non-interest expenses – other. in november 2021, the peruvian constitutional court dismissed the matter relating to the accrued default interest for procedural reasons. with respect to this default interest component, and in relation to the constitutional court of peru’s treatment of scotiabank peru, in october 2022, the bank filed a request for arbitration against the republic of peru before the international centre for the settlement of investment disputes (icsid), pursuant to the provisions of the canada-peru free trade agreement. in may 2024, the icsid tribunal issued a ruling that narrowed the scope of the bank’s case. this case is currently proceeding through the arbitration process. following these developments, the bank recorded a legal provision of $142 million in other liabilities – provisions, representing the amount at issue in the arbitration. the bank intends to continue to vigorously advance its position."

(i) assessment of allowance for credit losses (acl) refer to notes 3 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements. the bank’s acl on loans was $6,536 million as at october 31, 2024. the bank applies a three-stage approach to measure the acl, using an expected credit loss (ecl) approach as required under ifrs 9 financial instruments. the bank’s acl calculations are outputs of a set of complex models. the acl calculations reflect probability-weighted outcomes that consider multiple scenarios based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. the probability of default (pd), loss given default (lgd) and exposure at default (ead) inputs used to estimate ecl are modeled based on historical default and loss experience, and macroeconomic variables that are closely related with credit losses in the relevant portfolio. the bank assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination or where the financial asset is in default. if there has been a significant increase in credit risk or the financial asset is in default, then lifetime acl is recorded; otherwise, an acl equal to 12 month expected credit losses is recorded. the estimation of ecl for each stage and the assessment of significant increases in credit risk consider information about past events and current conditions as well as forecasts of future events and economic conditions. the estimation and application of forward- looking information requires significant judgment. qualitative adjustments or overlays may also be recorded as temporary adjustments using expert credit judgment where the inputs, assumptions and/or models do not capture all relevant risk factors. the use of management overlays requires significant judgment that may impact the amount of acl recognized. we identified the assessment of the acl as a key audit matter. significant auditor judgment was required because there was a high degree of measurement uncertainty due to the significant management judgments inherent in certain of the bank’s key modeled inputs and methodologies. these management judgments impact certain inputs, assumptions, qualitative adjustments or overlays, and the determination of when there has been a significant increase in credit risk. the assessment of the acl also required significant auditor attention and complex auditor judgment to apply and evaluate the results of audit procedures. further, specialized skills and knowledge, including experience in the industry, were required to apply audit procedures and evaluate the results of those procedures. the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter. with the involvement of our credit risk and economics professionals with specialized skills, industry knowledge and relevant experience, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the bank’s acl process. these included internal controls related to: (1) initial and periodic validation and performance monitoring of models used to derive key modeled inputs into the acl calculation being pd, lgd and ead; (2) benchmarking of certain macroeconomic variables, model validation associated with the derivation of the remaining variables and the alternative scenarios and review of probability weights used in the acl models; (3) the methodology used to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk; and (4) the methodology and assumptions used in the determination of qualitative adjustments or overlays. additionally, for non-retail loans, we tested certain internal controls related to loan reviews over the determination of loan risk grades. we involved credit risk and economics professionals with specialized skills, industry knowledge and relevant experience who assisted in: (1) evaluating the methodology and models used to derive key modeled inputs into the acl calculation being pd, lgd and ead and the determination of whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk; (2) assessing the appropriateness of certain underlying macroeconomic variables against external economic data, evaluating the models used to derive other macroeconomic variables and evaluating the assumptions associated with the alternative economic scenarios and the related probabilities; and (3) assessing the qualitative adjustments or overlays by applying our knowledge of the industry and credit judgment to evaluate the appropriateness of the bank’s underlying methodology and assumptions. additionally for a selection of non-retail loans, we evaluated the bank’s assigned loan risk grades against the bank’s borrower risk rating methodology. consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 137
consolidated financial statements (ii) assessment of the measurement of fair value of certain financial instruments refer to notes 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements. the bank measures certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. where such financial instruments trade in inactive markets or when using internal models where observable parameters do not exist, significant management judgment is required in the selection of valuation techniques and model inputs. the valuation techniques used in determining the fair value of financial instruments include internal models and net asset valuations. the significant unobservable inputs used in the bank’s valuation techniques include general partner valuations per net asset values (navs), interest rate volatility, equity volatility and equity correlation. we identified the assessment of the measurement of fair value for certain financial instruments as a key audit matter. significant auditor judgment was required because there was a high degree of measurement uncertainty due to significant judgments inherent in the bank’s valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used to develop the fair value of certain financial assets and financial liabilities. the assessment of the fair value also required significant auditor attention and complex auditor judgment to apply and evaluate the results of audit procedures. further, specialized skills and knowledge, including experience in the industry, were required to apply audit procedures and evaluate the results of those procedures. the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the bank’s processes to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments with the involvement of valuation and information technology professionals with specialized skills, industry knowledge and relevant experience. these included internal controls related to: (1) model validation at inception and periodically; (2) management’s review of navs; (3) independent price verification, including assessment of rate sources; and (4) segregation of duties and access controls. with the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills, industry knowledge and relevant experience, we tested the fair value of a selection of certain financial instruments. depending on the nature of the financial instruments, we did this by comparing the navs to external information or by developing an independent estimate of fair value and comparing it to the fair value determined by the bank. (iii) assessment of uncertain tax provisions refer to notes 3 and 28 to the consolidated financial statements. the bank maintains provisions for uncertain tax positions that it believes appropriately reflect the risk of tax positions under discussion, audit, dispute, or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. these provisions are made using the bank’s best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on an assessment of all relevant factors, which are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. we identified the assessment of some uncertain tax provisions as a key audit matter. significant auditor judgment was required because there was a high degree of measurement uncertainty due to the significant judgments inherent in the bank’s interpretation of tax legislation and its best estimate of the ultimate resolution of tax positions. this required significant auditor attention and complex auditor judgment to evaluate the results of audit procedures. further, specialized skills, industry knowledge, and relevant experience were required to apply audit procedures and evaluate the results of those procedures. the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the bank’s income tax uncertainties process with the involvement of taxation professionals with specialized skills, industry knowledge and relevant experience. these included internal controls related to: (1) the interpretation of tax legislation and the evaluation of the technical merits of tax positions; and (2) the determination of the best estimate of the provision required for these tax uncertainties. we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in (1) evaluating the bank’s interpretations of tax legislation based on our knowledge and experience; (2) reading and evaluating advice obtained by the bank from external counsel, and considering its impact on the measurement, if applicable, of the uncertain tax provisions; and (3) inspecting correspondence with applicable taxation authorities. other information management is responsible for the other information. other information comprises: • the information included in management’s discussion and analysis filed with the relevant canadian securities commissions; and • the information, other than the consolidated financial statements and the auditor’s report thereon, included in a document entitled 2024 annual report. our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. in connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit and remain alert for indications that the other information appears to be materially misstated. we obtained the information included in management’s discussion and analysis and 2024 annual report filed with the relevant canadian securities commissions as at the date of this auditor’s report. if, based on the work we have performed on this other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact in the auditor’s report. we have nothing to report in this regard. responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. in preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the bank’s financial reporting process. 138 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements. as part of an audit in accordance with canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. we also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the bank’s internal control. • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. however, future events or conditions may cause the bank to cease to continue as a going concern. • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. • provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. • obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the bank to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. • determine, from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. we describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our auditor’s report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. chartered professional accountants, licensed public accountants the engagement partner on the audit resulting in this auditor’s report is james edward newton. toronto, canada december 3, 2024 consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 139

152,166,material accounting policies the material accounting policies used,"transition to ifrs 17 on november 1, 2023",notes_consolidated_finnacial_statement,"material accounting policies the material accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, including any additional accounting requirements of osfi, as set out below, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, financial performance and cash flows of the bank and all of its subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances. subsidiaries are defined as entities controlled by the bank. the bank’s subsidiaries can be classified as entities controlled through voting interests or structured entities. the bank consolidates a subsidiary from the date it obtains control. for the bank to control an entity, all three elements of control should be in existence: • power over the investee; • exposure, or rights, to variable returns from involvement with the investee; and • the ability to use power over the investee to affect the amount of the bank’s returns. the bank does not control an investee when it is acting as an agent. the bank assesses whether it is an agent by determining whether it is primarily engaged to act on behalf of and for the benefit of another party or parties. the bank reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the elements of control has changed. voting-interest subsidiaries control is presumed with an ownership interest of more than 50% of the voting rights in an entity unless there are other factors that indicate that the bank does not control the entity despite having more than 50% of voting rights. the bank may consolidate an entity when it owns less than 50% of the voting rights when it has one or more other attributes of power: • by virtue of an agreement, over more than half of the voting rights; • to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity under a statute or an agreement; • to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors or equivalent governing body and control of the entity is by that board or body; or • to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity through the size of its holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holding of the other vote holders and voting patterns at shareholder meetings (i.e., de facto control). non-controlling interests are presented within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position separate from equity attributable to equity holders of the bank. the net income attributable to non-controlling interests is presented separately in the consolidated statement of income. partial sales and incremental purchases of interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions with non-controlling interest holders. any difference between the carrying amount of the interest and the transaction amount is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. structured entities structured entities are designed to accomplish certain well-defined objectives and for which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. the bank controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. the bank consolidates all structured entities that it controls. 150 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
investments in associates an associate is an entity in which the bank has significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the entity. investments in associates are recognized initially at cost, which includes the purchase price and other costs directly attributable to the purchase. associates are accounted for using the equity method which reflects the bank’s share of the increase or decrease of the post-acquisition earnings and other movements in the associate’s equity. investments in associates are evaluated for impairment at the end of each financial reporting period, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the existence of objective evidence of impairment. for purposes of applying the equity method for an investment that has a different reporting period from the bank, adjustments are made for the effects of any significant events or transactions that occur between the reporting date of the investment and the reporting date of the bank. joint arrangements the bank’s investments in joint arrangements over which the bank has joint control are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. similar to accounting for investments in associates, for joint ventures, investments are recognized initially at cost and accounted for using the equity method, which reflects the bank’s share of the increase or decrease of the post-acquisition earnings and other movements in the joint venture’s equity. investments in joint ventures are evaluated for impairment at the end of each financial reporting period, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the existence of objective evidence of impairment. for joint operations, the bank recognizes its direct rights to, and its share of jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. these have been incorporated in the consolidated financial statements under the appropriate headings. translation of foreign currencies the financial statements of each of the bank’s foreign operations are measured using its functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment of the foreign operation. translation gains and losses related to the bank’s monetary items are recognized in non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated using average exchange rates. foreign currency non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated into the functional currency at historical rates. foreign currency non-monetary items measured at fair value are translated into functional currency using the rate of exchange at the date the fair value was determined. foreign currency gains and losses on non-monetary items are recognized in the consolidated statement of income or consolidated statement of comprehensive income consistent with the gain or loss on the non-monetary item. unrealized gains and losses arising upon translation of foreign operations, together with any gains or losses arising from hedges of those net investment positions to the extent effective, are credited or charged to net change in unrealized foreign currency translation gains/losses in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. on disposal or meeting the definition of partial disposal of a foreign operation, an appropriate portion of the translation differences previously recognized in other comprehensive income are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. financial assets and liabilities recognition and initial measurement the bank, on the date of origination or purchase, recognizes loans, debt and equity securities, deposits and subordinated debentures at the fair value of the consideration paid or received. regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the settlement date. all other financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, are initially recognized on the trade date at which the bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. the initial measurement of a financial asset or liability is at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to its purchase or issuance. for instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs are recognized immediately in profit or loss. classification and measurement, derecognition, and impairment of financial instruments classification and measurement classification and measurement of financial assets financial assets include both debt and equity instruments, are classified into one of the following measurement categories: • amortized cost; • fair value through other comprehensive income (fvoci); • fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl); • elected at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities only); or • designated at fvtpl debt instruments debt instruments, including loans and debt securities, are classified into one of the following measurement categories: • amortized cost; • fair value through other comprehensive income (fvoci); • fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl); or • designated at fvtpl classification of debt instruments is determined based on: (i) the business model under which the asset is held; and (ii) the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 151
consolidated financial statements business model assessment a business model assessment involves determining how financial assets are managed to generate cash flows. the bank’s business model assessment is based on the following categories: • held to collect: the objective of this business model is to hold assets and collect contractual cash flows. any sales of the asset are incidental to the objective of the model. • held to collect and for sale: both collecting contractual cash flows and sales are integral to achieving the objectives of the business model. • other business model: the business model is neither held-to-collect nor held-to-collect and for sale. the bank assesses the business model at a portfolio level reflective of how groups of assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. for the assessment of a business model, the bank takes into consideration the following factors: • how the performance of assets in a portfolio is evaluated and reported to group heads and other key decision makers within the bank’s business lines; • how compensation is determined for the bank’s business lines’ management that manages the assets; • how the business lines’ management is compensated for managing the bank’s assets based on the fair value or the contractual cash flows collected; • whether the assets are held for trading purposes; • the risks that affect the performance of assets held within a business model and how those risks are managed; and • the frequency and volume of sales in prior periods and expectations about future sales activity. contractual cash flow characteristics assessment the contractual cash flow characteristics assessment involves assessing the contractual features of an instrument to determine if they give rise to cash flows that are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement if they represent cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (sppi). principal is defined as the fair value of the instrument at initial recognition. principal may change over the life of the instrument due to repayments or amortization of premium/discount. interest is defined as the consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding and for other basic lending risks and costs (liquidity risk and administrative costs), and a profit margin. if the bank identifies any contractual features that could significantly modify the cash flows of the instrument such that they are no longer consistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fvtpl. debt instruments measured at amortized cost debt instruments are measured at amortized cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. after initial measurement, debt instruments in this category are carried at amortized cost. interest income on these instruments is recognized in interest income using the effective interest rate method. the effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset. amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on the acquisition, transaction costs and fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. impairment on debt instruments measured at amortized cost is calculated using the expected credit loss approach. loans and debt securities measured at amortized cost are presented net of the allowance for credit losses (acl) in the statement of financial position. debt instruments measured at fvoci debt instruments are measured at fvoci if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent payments that are solely payments of principal and interest. subsequent to initial recognition, unrealized gains and losses on debt instruments measured at fvoci are recorded in other comprehensive income (oci), unless the instrument is designated in a fair value hedge relationship. when designated in a fair value hedge relationship, any changes in fair value due to changes in the hedged risk are recognized in non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income, along with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument. upon derecognition, realized gains and losses are reclassified from oci and recorded in non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to the amortized cost of the debt instrument are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. premiums, discounts and related transaction costs are amortized over the expected life of the instrument to interest income in the consolidated statement of income using the effective interest rate method. impairment on debt instruments measured at fvoci is determined using the expected credit loss approach. the acl on debt instruments measured at fvoci does not reduce the carrying amount of the asset in the consolidated statement of financial position, which remains at its fair value. instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the assets were measured at amortized cost is recognized in oci with a corresponding charge to provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. the accumulated allowance recognized in oci is recycled to the consolidated statement of income upon derecognition of the debt instrument. debt instruments measured at fvtpl debt instruments are measured at fvtpl if assets: (i) are held for trading purposes; (ii) are held as part of a portfolio managed on a fair value basis; or (iii) whose cash flows do not represent payments that are solely payments of principal and interest. these instruments are measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position, with transaction costs recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income as part of non-interest income. realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized as part of non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. debt instruments designated at fvtpl the bank designates certain debt instruments at fvtpl upon initial recognition, and the designation is irrevocable. the fvtpl designation is available when a fair value is reliably estimated, and doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise. 152 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
debt instruments designated at fvtpl are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value. changes in fair value are recognized in non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. equity instruments equity instruments are classified into one of the following measurement categories: • fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl); or • elected at fair value through other comprehensive income (fvoci). equity instruments measured at fvtpl equity instruments are measured at fvtpl, unless an election is made to designate them at fvoci upon purchase, with transaction costs recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income as part of non-interest income. subsequent to initial recognition, the changes in fair value and dividends received are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. equity instruments measured at fvoci at initial recognition, the bank has an option to classify non-trading equity instruments at fvoci. this election is irrevocable and is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. gains and losses on these instruments, including when derecognized/sold, are recorded in oci and are not subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of income. as such, there is no specific impairment requirement. dividends received are recorded in interest income in the consolidated statement of income. any transaction costs incurred upon purchase of the security are added to the cost basis of the security and are not reclassified to the consolidated statement of income on sale of the security. classification and measurement of financial liabilities financial liabilities are classified into one of the following measurement categories: • fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl); • amortized cost; or • designated at fvtpl. financial liabilities measured at fvtpl financial liabilities measured at fvtpl are held principally for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term, or form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short term profit-taking. financial liabilities are recognized on a trade date basis and accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value and any gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statement of income as part of the non-interest income. transaction costs are expensed as incurred. financial liabilities measured at amortized cost deposits, subordinated notes and debentures are accounted for at amortized cost. interest on deposits, calculated using the effective interest rate method, is recognized as interest expense. interest on subordinated notes and debentures, including capitalized transaction costs, is recognized using the effective interest rate method as interest expense. financial liabilities designated at fvtpl the bank designates certain financial liabilities at fvtpl upon initial recognition, and the designation is irrevocable. the fvtpl designation is available when a fair value is reliably estimated. financial liabilities are designated at fvtpl when it meets one of the following criteria: • the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise; or • a group of financial liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in line with a documented risk management strategy; or • the financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives which significantly modify the cash flows otherwise required. financial liabilities designated at fvtpl are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value. any changes in fair value are recognized in non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income, except for changes in fair value arising from changes in the bank’s own credit risk which are recognized in oci. changes in fair value due to changes in the bank’s own credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to the consolidated statement of income upon derecognition/extinguishment of the liabilities. determination of fair value the fair value of a financial asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal, or in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the bank has access at the measurement date. the bank values instruments carried at fair value using quoted market prices, where available. fair value based on unadjusted quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets represents a level 1 valuation. when quoted market prices are not available, the bank maximizes the use of observable inputs within valuation models. when a fair value is based on all significant market observable inputs, the valuation is classified as level 2. valuations that require the significant use of unobservable inputs are considered level 3. inception gains and losses are only recognized where the valuation is dependent on observable market data; otherwise, they are deferred and amortized over the life of the related contract or until the valuation inputs become observable. ifrs 13, fair value measurement permits a measurement exception that allows an entity to determine the fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities with offsetting risks based on the sale or transfer of its net exposure to a particular risk (or risks). the bank has adopted this exception through an accounting policy choice. consequently, the fair values of certain portfolios of financial instruments are determined based on the net exposure of those instruments to market, credit or funding risk. in determining fair value for certain instruments or portfolios of instruments, valuation adjustments or reserves may be required to arrive at a more accurate representation of fair value. these adjustments include those made for credit risk, bid-offer spreads, unobservable parameters, funding costs and constraints on prices in inactive or illiquid markets. consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 153
consolidated financial statements derecognition of financial assets and liabilities derecognition of financial assets a financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset has expired; or the bank transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the financial asset; or has assumed an obligation to pay those cash flows to an independent third-party; or the bank has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of that asset to an independent third-party. management determines whether substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred by quantitatively comparing the variability in cash flows before and after the transfer. if the variability in cash flows remains significantly similar subsequent to the transfer, the bank has retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are neither retained nor transferred, the bank derecognizes the transferred asset only if it has lost control over that asset. control over the asset is represented by the practical ability to sell the transferred asset. if the bank retains control over the asset, it will continue to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. at times such continuing involvement may be in the form of investment in senior or subordinated tranches of notes issued by non-consolidated structured entities. on derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. transfers of financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition are reported as secured financings in the consolidated statement of financial position. the derecognition criteria are applied to the transfer of part of an asset, rather than the asset as a whole, only if such part comprises specifically identified cash flows from the asset, a fully proportionate share of the cash flows from the asset, or a fully proportionate share of specifically identified cash flows from the asset. derecognition of financial liabilities a financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, canceled or expires. if an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same counterparty on substantially different terms, or the terms of the existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability at fair value. the difference in the respective carrying amount of the existing liability and the new liability is recognized as a gain/loss in the consolidated statement of income. impairment scope the bank applies a three-stage approach to measure allowance for credit losses, using an expected credit loss approach as required under ifrs 9, for the following categories of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss: • amortized cost financial assets; • debt securities classified as at fvoci; • off-balance sheet loan commitments; and • financial guarantee contracts. expected credit loss impairment model the bank’s allowance for credit losses calculations are outputs of models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. the expected credit loss impairment model reflects the present value of all cash shortfalls related to default events either (i) over the following twelve months or (ii) over the expected life of a financial instrument depending on credit deterioration from inception. the allowance for credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability-weighted outcome which considers multiple scenarios based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. this impairment model measures credit loss allowances using a three-stage approach based on the extent of credit deterioration since origination: • stage 1 – where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk (sir) since initial recognition of a financial instrument, an amount equal to 12 months expected credit loss is recorded. the expected credit loss is computed using a probability of default occurring over the next 12 months. for those instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, a probability of default corresponding to remaining term to maturity is used. • stage 2 – when a financial instrument experiences a sir subsequent to origination but is not considered to be in default, it is included in stage 2. this requires the computation of expected credit loss based on the probability of default over the remaining estimated life of the financial instrument. • stage 3 – financial instruments that are considered to be in default are included in this stage. similar to stage 2, the allowance for credit losses captures the lifetime expected credit losses. measurement of expected credit loss the probability of default (pd), exposure at default (ead), and loss given default (lgd) inputs used to estimate expected credit losses are modelled based on macroeconomic variables that are closely related with credit losses in the relevant portfolio. details of these statistical parameters/inputs are as follows: • pd – the probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. a default may only happen at a certain time over the remaining estimated life if the facility has not been previously derecognized and is still in the portfolio. • ead – the exposure at default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, considering expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments. • lgd – the loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. it is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realization of any collateral. it is usually expressed as a percentage of the ead. 154 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
forward-looking information the estimation of expected credit losses for each stage and the assessment of significant increases in credit risk consider information about past events and current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and economic conditions. the estimation and application of forward-looking information may require significant judgment. macroeconomic factors in its models, the bank relies on a broad range of forward-looking economic information as inputs, such as: gdp growth, unemployment rates, central bank interest rates, and house-price indices. the inputs and models used for calculating expected credit losses may not always capture all characteristics of the market at the date of the financial statements. qualitative adjustments or overlays may be made as temporary adjustments using expert credit judgment. multiple forward-looking scenarios the bank determines its allowance for credit losses using four probability-weighted forward-looking scenarios. the bank considers both internal and external sources of information and data in order to achieve unbiased projections and forecasts. the bank prepares the scenarios using forecasts generated by scotiabank economics (se). the forecasts are created using internal and external models which are modified by se as necessary to formulate a ‘base case’ view of the most probable future direction of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios. the process involves the development of three additional economic scenarios and consideration of the relative probabilities of each outcome. the ‘base case’ represents the most likely outcome and is aligned with information used by the bank for other purposes such as strategic planning and budgeting. the other scenarios represent more optimistic and more pessimistic outcomes. the bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macroeconomic variables, credit risk, and credit losses. assessment of significant increase in credit risk (sir) at each reporting date, the bank assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for exposures since initial recognition by comparing the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected life from the reporting date and the date of initial recognition. the assessment considers borrower-specific quantitative and qualitative information without consideration of collateral, and the impact of forward-looking macroeconomic factors. the common assessments for sir on retail and non-retail portfolios include macroeconomic outlook, management judgement, and delinquency and monitoring. forward-looking macroeconomic factors are a key component of the macroeconomic outlook. the importance and relevance of each specific macroeconomic factor depends on the type of product, characteristics of the financial instruments and the borrower and the geographical region. quantitative models may not always be able to capture all reasonable and supportable information that may indicate a significant increase in credit risk. qualitative factors may be assessed to supplement the gap. examples of situations include changes in adjudication criteria for a particular group of borrowers; changes in portfolio composition; and natural disasters impacting certain portfolios. with regards to delinquency and monitoring, there is a rebuttable presumption that the credit risk of the financial instrument has increased since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days overdue. retail portfolio – for retail exposures, a significant increase in credit risk is assessed based on thresholds that exist by product which consider the change in pd. the thresholds used for pd migration are reviewed and assessed at least annually unless there is a significant change in credit risk management practices in which case the review is brought forward. non-retail portfolio – the bank uses a risk rating scale (ig codes) for its non-retail exposures. all non-retail exposures have an ig code assigned that reflects the probability of default of the borrower. both borrower specific and non-borrower specific (i.e. macroeconomic) forward looking information is considered and reflected in the ig rating. significant increase in credit risk is evaluated based on the migration of the exposures among ig codes. expected life when measuring expected credit loss, the bank considers the maximum contractual period over which the bank is exposed to credit risk. all contractual terms are considered when determining the expected life, including prepayment, and extension and rollover options. for certain revolving credit facilities, such as credit cards, the expected life is estimated based on the period over which the bank is exposed to credit risk and how the credit losses are mitigated by management actions. presentation of allowance for credit losses in the statement of financial position • financial assets measured at amortized cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the financial assets; • debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: no allowance is recognized in the statement of financial position because the carrying value of these assets is their fair value. however, the allowance determined is presented in the accumulated other comprehensive income; • off-balance sheet credit risks include undrawn lending commitments, letters of credit and letters of guarantee: as a provision in other liabilities. modified financial assets if the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one, an assessment is made to determine if the existing financial asset should be derecognized. where a modification does not result in derecognition, the date of origination continues to be used to determine sir. where a modification results in derecognition, the new financial asset is recognized at its fair value on the modification date. the modification date is also the date of origination for this new asset. the bank may modify the contractual terms of loans for either commercial or credit reasons. the terms of a loan in good standing may be modified for commercial reasons to provide competitive pricing to borrowers. loans are also modified for credit reasons where the contractual terms are modified to grant a concession to a borrower that may be experiencing financial difficulty. consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 155
consolidated financial statements for all financial assets modifications of the contractual terms may result in derecognition of the original asset when the changes to the terms of the loans are considered substantial. these terms include interest rate, authorized amount or term. the original loan is derecognized, and the new loan is recognized at its fair value. the difference between the carrying value of the derecognized asset and the fair value of the new asset is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. for all loans, performing and credit-impaired, where the modification of terms did not result in the derecognition of the loan, the gross carrying amount of the modified loan is recalculated based on the present value of the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate and any gain or loss from the modification is recorded in the provision for credit losses line in the consolidated statement of income. definition of default the bank considers a financial instrument to be in default as a result of one or more loss events that occurred after the date of initial recognition of the instrument and the loss event has a negative impact on the estimated future cash flows of the instrument that can be reliably estimated. this includes events that indicate: • significant financial difficulty of the borrower; • default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; • high probability of the borrower entering a phase of bankruptcy or a financial reorganization; • measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from the loan or the underlying assets that back the loan. the bank considers that default has occurred and classifies the financial asset as impaired when it is more than 90 days past due, except for credit card receivables that are treated as defaulted when 180 days past due, unless reasonable and supportable information demonstrates that a more lagging default criterion is appropriate. write-off policy the bank writes off an impaired financial asset (and the related impairment allowance), either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. where financial assets are secured, write-off is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realization of security. in circumstances where the net realizable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write-off may be earlier. credit card receivables 180 days past due are written-off. in subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. purchased loans all purchased loans are initially measured at fair value on the date of acquisition. as a result, no allowance for credit losses would be recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position on the date of acquisition. purchased loans may fit into either of the two categories: performing loans or purchased credit-impaired (pci) loans. purchased performing loans follow the same accounting as originated performing loans and are reflected in stage 1 on the date of the acquisition. they will be subject to a 12-month allowance for credit losses which is recorded as a provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. the fair value adjustment set up for these loans on the date of acquisition is amortized into interest income over the life of these loans. pci loans are reflected in stage 3 and are always subject to lifetime allowance for credit losses. any changes in the expected cash flows since the date of acquisition are recorded as a charge/recovery in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income at the end of all reporting periods subsequent to the date of acquisition. modification of financial instruments in the context of interest rate benchmark reform – phase 2 amendments when the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortized cost is changed as a result of interest rate benchmark reform (ibor reform), the bank updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability similar to a floating rate financial instrument and does not derecognize or adjust the carrying amount (the practical expedient). the practical expedient is applied only when the modification is required as a direct consequence of ibor reform, and the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis. if changes are made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by the interest rate benchmark reform, then the bank sequentially updates the effective interest first to reflect the change required by ibor reform and then applies its policies on modification or derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. offsetting of financial instruments financial assets and financial liabilities with the same counterparty are offset, with the net amount reported in the consolidated statement of financial position, only if there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. when financial assets and financial liabilities are offset in the consolidated statement of financial position, the related income and expense items will also be offset in the consolidated statement of income, unless specifically prohibited by an applicable accounting standard. cash and deposits with financial institutions cash and deposits with financial institutions comprise cash, cash equivalents, demand deposits with banks and other financial institutions, and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash, subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. these investments are those with less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition. precious metals precious metals are carried at fair value less costs to sell, and any changes in value are credited or charged to non-interest income – trading revenues in the consolidated statement of income. securities purchased and sold under resale agreements securities purchased under resale agreements (reverse repurchase agreements) require the purchase of securities by the bank from a counterparty with an agreement entered to resell the securities at a fixed price at a future date. since the bank is reselling the securities at a fixed price at a future date, the risks and rewards have not been transferred to the bank. the bank has the right to liquidate the securities purchased in the event of counterparty default. 156 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
whereas securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) require the sale of securities by the bank to a counterparty with an agreement entered simultaneously to purchase the securities back at a fixed price at a future date. since the bank is purchasing the securities back at a fixed price at a future date, the risks and rewards have not been transferred from the bank. the counterparty has the right to use the collateral pledged by the bank in the event of default. these agreements are treated as collateralized financing arrangements and are initially recognized at amortized cost. the party disbursing the cash takes possession of the securities serving as collateral for the financing and having a market value equal to, or more than, the principal amount loaned. the securities received under reverse repurchase agreements and securities delivered under repurchase agreements are not recognized on, or derecognized from, the consolidated statement of financial position, unless the risks and rewards of ownership are obtained or relinquished. the related interest income and interest expense are recorded on an accrual basis using the effective interest rate in the consolidated statement of income. obligations related to securities sold short obligations related to securities sold short arise in dealing and market-making activities where debt securities and equity shares are sold without possessing such securities. similarly, if securities purchased under an agreement to resell are subsequently sold to third parties, the obligation to return the securities is recorded as a short sale within obligations related to securities sold short in the consolidated statement of financial position. these trading liabilities are measured at fair value with any gains or losses included in non-interest income – trading revenues in the consolidated statement of income. interest expense accruing on debt securities sold short is recorded in the consolidated statement of income. securities lending and borrowing securities lending and borrowing transactions are usually collateralized by securities or cash. the transfer of the securities to counterparties is only reflected on the consolidated statement of financial position if the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred. for cash collateral advanced or received, the bank presents these transactions as securities sold under a repurchase agreement or securities purchased under a reverse repurchase agreement, respectively. interest income on cash collateral paid and interest expense on cash collateral received together with securities lending income and securities borrowing fee are reported in the consolidated statement of income. securities borrowed are not recognized on the consolidated statement of financial position unless they are then sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return the securities is recorded as a trading liability and measured at fair value with any gains or losses included in non-interest income – trading revenues, in the consolidated statement of income. derivative instruments derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices or other financial variables. most derivative instruments can be characterized as interest rate contracts, foreign exchange and gold contracts, commodity contracts, equity contracts or credit contracts. derivative instruments are either exchange-traded contracts or negotiated over-the-counter contracts. negotiated over-the-counter contracts include swaps, forwards and options. the bank enters into these derivative contracts for trading purposes, as well as to manage its risk exposures (i.e., to manage the bank’s non-trading interest rate, foreign currency and other risk exposures). trading activities are undertaken to meet the needs of the bank’s customers, as well as for the bank’s own account. derivatives embedded in other financial liabilities or host contracts are treated as separate stand-alone derivatives when the following conditions are met: • their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract; • a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and • the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss. where an embedded derivative is separable from the host contract but the fair value, as at the acquisition or reporting date, cannot be reliably measured separately, the entire combined contract is measured at fair value. all embedded derivatives are presented on the consolidated statement of financial position on a combined basis with the host contracts. changes in fair value of embedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract are recognized in non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. all derivatives, including embedded derivatives that must be separately accounted for, are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position. the determination of the fair value of derivatives includes consideration of credit risk, estimated funding costs and ongoing direct costs over the life of the instruments. inception gains or losses on derivatives are only recognized where the valuation is dependent on observable market data; otherwise, they are deferred and amortized over the life of the related contract, or until the valuation inputs become observable. the gains and losses resulting from changes in fair values of trading derivatives are included in non-interest income – trading revenues in the consolidated statement of income. changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in the consolidated statement of income in non-interest income – other. where derivative instruments are used to manage the volatility of share-based payment expense, these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value in relation to units hedged included in non-interest expenses – salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statement of income. changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded as non-interest income – other in the consolidated statement of income for fair value hedges and other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. hedge accounting the bank has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of ias 39. also, the bank has implemented the additional hedge accounting disclosures that are required by the ifrs 9 related amendments to ifrs 7 financial instruments: disclosures. the bank formally documents all hedging relationships and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking these hedge transactions at inception. the hedge documentation includes identification of the asset, liability, firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction being hedged, the nature of the risk being hedged, the hedging instrument used, and the method used to assess the effectiveness of the hedge. consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 157
consolidated financial statements the bank also formally assesses, both at each hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items within an 80-125% range. this assessment incorporates a comparison of critical terms of the hedged and hedging item, and regression analysis, in order to determine (i) whether the hedge relationship is expected to be highly effective going forward (i.e. prospective effectiveness assessment) and (ii) whether the hedge was actually highly effective for the designated period (i.e. retrospective effectiveness assessment). in assessing prospective hedge effectiveness for a hedge relationship directly impacted by the ibor reform, the bank will assume that the benchmark interest rate is not altered as a result of the ibor reform. in instances of assessing retrospective hedge effectiveness where a hedge relationship directly impacted by the ibor reform falls outside of the 80-125% range solely as a result of the ibor reform, the bank will continue hedge accounting as long as other hedge accounting requirements are met. hedge ineffectiveness is measured and recorded in non-interest income – other in the consolidated statement of income. when the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of existing hedge relationships changes as a result of the ibor reform, the bank updates the hedge documentation without discontinuing the hedging relationship. for cash flow hedges where the interest benchmark changes as a result of the ibor reform, the bank deems that the corresponding hedge reserve in oci is based on the alternative benchmark rate to determine whether the hedged future cash flows are expected to occur. for changes that are in addition to those required by the ibor reform, the bank first determines whether the additional changes result in discontinuation of hedge relationships before applying the relief. in addition, when determining the hedged risk, the bank may designate an alternative benchmark rate risk component that is not currently separately identifiable, as the bank reasonably expects that the alternative benchmark rate will become separately identifiable within a 24-month period from its first designation. there are three types of hedges: (i) fair value hedges, (ii) cash flow hedges and (iii) net investment hedges. fair value hedges for fair value hedges, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is offset in the consolidated statement of income by the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. for hedges that are discontinued, the hedged item is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value. the cumulative fair value adjustment of the hedged item is amortized to interest income over its remaining term to maturity or written off to non-interest income directly if the hedged item ceases to exist. the bank uses fair value hedges primarily to convert fixed rate financial instruments to floating rate financial instruments. hedged items include debt securities, loans, deposit liabilities and subordinated debentures. hedging instruments include single-currency interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps. cash flow hedges for cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument, to the extent effective, is recorded in other comprehensive income until the corresponding gains and losses on the hedged item are recognized in income. for hedges that are discontinued, the cumulative unrealized gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to interest income and/or salaries and employee benefits as the variability in the cash flows of hedged item affects income. however, if the hedged item is derecognized or the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified immediately to non-interest income and/or salaries and employee benefits. the bank uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the variability in cash flows relating to floating rate financial instruments and highly probable forecasted revenues and expenses. hedged items include debt securities, loans, deposit liabilities, subordinated debentures and highly probable forecasted transactions. hedging instruments include single-currency interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, total return swaps, foreign currency forwards and foreign currency assets or liabilities. for the bank’s cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions that are directly affected by the ibor reform, it is assumed that the benchmark interest rate will not be altered as a result of the ibor reform for purposes of assessing whether the transactions are highly probable or whether the transactions are still expected to occur. net investment hedges for net investment hedges, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument, to the extent effective, is recorded in other comprehensive income until the corresponding cumulative translation adjustments on the hedged net investment are recognized in income. the bank designates foreign currency liabilities and foreign currency forwards as hedging instruments to manage the foreign currency exposure and impact on capital ratios arising from foreign operations. property and equipment land is carried at cost. buildings (including building fittings), equipment, and leasehold improvements are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset less any residual value as follows: buildings – up to 40 years, building fittings – up to 15 years, equipment 3 to 10 years, and leasehold improvements – lease term determined by the bank. depreciation expense is included in the consolidated statement of income under non-interest expenses – depreciation and amortization. depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each financial year-end and adjusted as appropriate. when major components of building and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately and depreciated over each component’s estimated useful life. net gains and losses on disposal are included in non-interest income – other in the consolidated statement of income in the year of disposal. assets held-for-sale non-current non-financial assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held-for-sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. these assets meet the criteria for classification as held-for-sale if they are available for immediate sale in their present condition and their sale is considered highly probable to occur within one year. non-current non-financial assets classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are presented within other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. any subsequent write-down to fair value less costs to sell is recognized in the consolidated statement of income, in non-interest income. any subsequent increase in the fair value less costs to sell, to the extent this does not exceed the cumulative write-down, is also recognized in non-interest income, together with any realized gains or losses on disposal. non-financial assets acquired in exchange for loans as part of an orderly realization are recorded as assets held-for-sale or assets held-for-use. if the acquired asset does not meet the requirement to be considered held-for-sale, the asset is considered held-for-use, measured initially at cost which equals the carrying value of the loan and accounted for in the same manner as a similar asset acquired in the normal course of business. 158 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
business combinations and goodwill the bank follows the acquisition method of accounting for the acquisition of a business. the bank considers the date on which control is obtained and it legally transfers the consideration for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the subsidiary to be the date of acquisition. the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration paid. the fair value of the consideration transferred by the bank in a business combination is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred by the bank, the liabilities incurred by the bank to former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests, including any options, issued by the bank. the bank recognizes the acquisition date fair values of any previously held investment in the subsidiary and contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquisition. a gain or loss on any previously held investments of an acquiree is recognized in non-interest income – other in the consolidated statement of income. in general, all identifiable assets acquired (including intangible assets) and liabilities assumed (including any contingent liabilities) are measured at the acquisition date fair value. the bank records identifiable intangible assets irrespective of whether the assets have been recognized by the acquiree before the business combination. non-controlling interests, if any, are recognized at their proportionate share of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities, unless otherwise indicated. where the bank has an obligation to purchase a non-controlling interest for cash or another financial asset, a financial liability is recognized based on management’s best estimate of the present value of the redemption amount. where the bank has a corresponding option to settle the purchase of a non-controlling interest by issuing its own common shares, no financial liability is recorded. any excess of the cost of acquisition over the bank’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. if the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the bank’s share of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the resulting gain is recognized immediately in non-interest income – other in the consolidated statement of income. during the measurement period (which is within one year from the acquisition date), the bank may, on a retrospective basis, adjust the amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. the bank accounts for acquisition-related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received. subsequent to acquisition, the bank accounts for the following assets and liabilities recognized in a business combination as described below: • contingent liabilities, until resolved, are measured at the higher of the amount that would be recognized as a provision or the amount initially recognized, with any change recognized in the consolidated statement of income. • indemnification assets are measured on the same basis as the item to which the indemnification relates. • contingent consideration classified as a liability is measured at fair value, with any change recognized in the consolidated statement of income. • liabilities to non-controlling interest holders when remeasured at the end of each reporting period, a corresponding change is recorded in equity. after initial recognition of goodwill in a business combination, goodwill in aggregate is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. goodwill is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, on the acquisition date, allocated to each of the bank’s group of cash-generating units (cgus) that is expected to benefit from the combination. cgus to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. the bank determines the carrying value of the cgu using a regulatory capital approach based on credit, market, operational risks and leverage, consistent with the bank’s capital attribution for business line performance measurement. corporate capital that is not directly attributable is allocated to each cgu on a proportional basis, based on the relative attributed capital prior to the corporate capital allocation. the recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs of disposal (fvlcd) and value in use (viu). if either fvlcd or viu exceeds the carrying amount, there is no need to determine the other. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the cgu exceeds the recoverable amount. an impairment loss, in respect of goodwill, is not reversed. fvlcd is the price that would be received from the sale of a cgu in an orderly transaction between market participants, less cost of disposal, at the measurement date. in determining fvlcd, an appropriate valuation model is used which considers various factors, including normalized net income, control premiums and price earnings multiples. these calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples and quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators. viu is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from a cgu. the determination of viu involves judgment in estimating cash flow projections, discount rate and terminal growth rate. the future cash flows are based on management approved budgets and plans which factor in market trends, macroeconomic conditions, forecasted earnings and business strategy for the cgu. the discount rate is based on the cost of capital while the terminal growth rate is based on the long-term growth expectations in the relevant countries. intangible assets intangible assets represent identifiable non-monetary assets and are acquired either separately, through a business combination, or generated internally. the bank’s intangible assets are mainly comprised of computer software, customer relationships, contract intangibles, core deposit intangibles and fund management contracts. the cost of a separately acquired intangible asset includes its purchase price and directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use. intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are initially recognized at fair value. in respect of internally generated intangible assets, initial measurement includes all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. after initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. intangible assets that have finite useful lives are initially measured at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives as follows: computer software – 5 to 10 years; and other intangible assets – 5 to 20 years. amortization expense is included in the consolidated statement of income under operating expenses – depreciation and amortization. as intangible assets are non-financial assets, the impairment model for non-financial assets is applied. intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. intangible assets with finite useful lives are only tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 159
consolidated financial statements impairment of non-financial assets the carrying amount of the bank’s non-financial assets, other than goodwill, indefinite life intangible assets and deferred tax assets, which are separately addressed, is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. for the purpose of impairment testing, non-financial assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent from the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets. if any indication of impairment exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. the recoverable amount of an asset or cgu is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. the bank’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows. if there is an indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, then the recoverable amount is determined for the cgu to which the corporate asset belongs. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or a cgu exceeds its recoverable amount. impairment losses of continuing operations are recognized in the consolidated statement of income in those expense categories consistent with the nature of the impaired asset. impairment losses recognized in prior periods are reassessed at each reporting date for any indication that the loss had decreased or no longer exists. an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. such reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. significant judgment is applied in determining the non-financial asset’s recoverable amount and assessing whether certain events or circumstances constitute objective evidence of impairment. corporate income taxes the bank follows the balance sheet liability method for corporate income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the cumulative amount of tax applicable to temporary differences, which are the differences between the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, and their values for tax purposes. deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the benefit of these deferred tax assets can be utilized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they arise in the same tax reporting group and where the bank has both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. the bank maintains provisions for uncertain tax positions that it believes appropriately reflect the risk of tax positions under discussion, audit, dispute or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. these provisions are made using the bank’s best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on an assessment of all relevant factors, which are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. it is possible that additional liability and income tax expense could arise in the future, depending on the acceptance of the bank’s tax positions by the relevant tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which the bank operates. income tax is recognized in the consolidated statement of income, except where it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case income tax is recognized in the same line as the related item. leases at inception of a contract, the bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. a contract is a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. when the bank is a lessee, it recognizes a right-of-use (rou) asset and a lease liability, except for short-term leases for assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value items. for short-term leases and low value items, the bank recognizes the lease payment associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. asset a rou is an asset that represents a lessee’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. the rou asset is initially measured at cost, which is based on the initial amount of the lease liability, any direct costs incurred, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of lease incentives received and estimated decommissioning costs. the rou asset is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. the rou asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the rou asset or the end of the lease term. the depreciation is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statement of income. in addition, the rou asset is adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. liability at commencement date, the bank initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the future lease payments, discounted using the bank’s incremental borrowing rate that takes into account the bank’s credit risk and economic environment in which the lease is entered. the lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. it is re-measured if the bank changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. interest expense is recorded in interest expense – other in the consolidated statement of income. when the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the rou asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. presentation the bank presents rou assets in property and equipment and lease liabilities in other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. determining lease term the bank’s expectation of exercising the option to renew a lease is determined by assessing if the bank is “reasonably certain” to exercise that option. the bank will be reasonably certain to exercise an option when factors create a significant economic incentive to do so. this assessment considers the following criteria: key locations for its branch network, locations on which the bank has spent significant capital on renovation work, contribution to profit, value of locations based on current economic environment and the remaining term of existing leases. 160 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
provisions a provision, including for restructuring, is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the bank has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. the amount recognized as a provision is the bank’s best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. if the effect of the time value of money is considered material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recorded as interest expense – other in the consolidated statement of income. insurance contracts the bank identifies its insurance contracts under which it accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder. for short duration contracts, the bank applies the premium allocation approach which requires that the expected premium be recognized into income over the coverage period and a liability for remaining coverage be established to the extent that cash inflows are received earlier than the recognition of premiums into insurance revenue. a liability for incurred claims is established based on expected claims and expenses, with a risk adjustment for non-financial risk, required to settle past insured events. for long duration contracts, the bank recognizes probability-weighted discounted fulfilment cashflows and a risk adjustment for non-financial risk for groups of contracts. to the extent that those groups of contracts are expected to be profitable, a contractual service margin liability is recognized on the consolidated statement of financial position which represents unearned profits that will be recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the future over the life of the contract. insurance revenue is earned over the period the bank provides insurance coverage and as risk is released. for all insurance contracts, losses on onerous contracts are recognized in income immediately. guarantees a guarantee is a contract that contingently requires the bank to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor failed to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. guarantees include standby letters of credit, letters of guarantee, indemnifications, credit enhancements and other similar contracts. guarantees that qualify as a derivative are accounted for in accordance with the policy for derivative instruments. for guarantees that do not qualify as a derivative, a liability is recorded for the fair value of the obligation assumed at inception. the fair value of the obligation at inception is generally based on the discounted cash flow of the premium to be received for the guarantee, resulting in a corresponding asset. subsequent to initial recognition, such guarantees are measured at the higher of the initial amount, less amortization to recognize any fee income earned over the period, and the best estimate of the amount required to settle any financial obligation arising as a result of the guarantee. any increase in the liability is reported in the consolidated statement of income. employee benefits the bank provides pension and other benefit plans for eligible employees in canada and internationally. pension benefits are offered in the form of defined benefit pension plans (generally based on an employee’s length of service and earnings) and defined contribution pension plans (where the bank’s contribution is fixed and there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts). other benefits provided include post- retirement health care, dental care and life insurance, along with other long-term employee benefits, such as long-term disability benefits. defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans the cost of these employee benefits is actuarially determined each year using the projected unit credit method. the calculation uses management’s best estimate of a number of assumptions, including the discount rate, future compensation, health care costs, mortality, as well as the retirement age of employees. the most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation, which is set by reference to the yields on high quality corporate bonds that have durations that match the terms of the bank’s obligations. separate discount rates are used to determine the annual benefit expense in canada and the u.s. these rates are determined with reference to the yields on high quality corporate bonds with durations that match the various components of the annual benefit expense. the discount rate used to determine the annual benefit expense for all other plans is the same as the rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation. the bank’s net asset or liability in respect of employee benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan as the difference between the present value of future benefits earned in respect of service for prior periods and the fair value of plan assets. the net asset or liability is included in other assets and other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated statement of financial position. when the net amount in the consolidated statement of financial position is an asset, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. the current service cost, net interest expense (income), past service cost (credit), settlement gain (loss) and administrative expense are recognized in net income. net interest expense (income) is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset or liability. when the benefits of a plan are improved (reduced), a past service cost (credit) is recognized immediately in net income. remeasurements comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets in excess of or less than the interest income on the fair value of assets are recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of financial position with a charge or credit to the statement of other comprehensive income (oci) in the period in which they occur. amounts recorded in oci are not recycled to the consolidated statement of income. other long-term employee benefits other long-term employee benefits are accounted for similarly to defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans described above, except that remeasurements are recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which they arise. defined contribution plans the costs of such plans are equal to contributions payable by the bank to employees’ accounts for service rendered during the period and expensed. consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 161
consolidated financial statements short-term employee benefits short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided and a liability is measured on an undiscounted basis net of payments made. interest and similar income and expenses for all non-trading interest-bearing financial instruments, interest income or expense is recorded in net interest income using the effective interest rate. this is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. the calculation takes into account all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) and includes any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and are an integral part of the effective interest rate, but not future credit losses. for trading financial instruments, mark-to-market changes including related interest income or expense are recorded in non-interest income – trading revenues. the carrying amount of interest-bearing financial instruments, measured at amortized cost or classified as fvoci, is adjusted if the bank revises its estimates of payments or receipts. the adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective interest rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as non-interest income in the consolidated statement of income. once the carrying value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, interest income continues to be recognized based on net effective interest rate inherent in the investment. loan origination costs are deferred and amortized into interest income using the effective interest method over the expected term of the loan. loan fees are recognized in interest income over the appropriate lending or commitment period. mortgage prepayment fees are recognized in interest income when received, unless they relate to a minor modification to the terms of the mortgage, in which case the fees are deferred and amortized using the effective interest method over the remaining period of the original mortgage. loan syndication fees are deferred and amortized in interest income over the term of the loan where the yield the bank retains is less than that of the comparable lenders in the syndicate. loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down and other credit related fees are deferred (together with any incremental costs) and recognized as part of the interest income on the loan. when it is unlikely that a loan will be drawn down, the loan commitment fees are recognized in non-interest income. fee and commission revenues revenue is recognized once the bank’s customer has obtained control of the service. the transfer of control occurs when the bank’s customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits of the banking services and the contractual performance obligation to the customer has been satisfied. the bank records revenue gross of expenses where it is the principal in performing a service to the customer and net of expenses where the bank is an agent for these services. the assessment of principal or agent requires judgement on the basis of whether the bank controls the services before they are transferred to the customer. from time to time, the bank may receive variable consideration such as performance fees. these fees are only recognized when it is highly probable that the bank will not need to reverse a significant amount of revenue. card revenues include interchange fees, annual fees and other card related fees. interchange fees are calculated as a percentage of the transaction and are recognized on the transaction date. annual fees are recognized in income over 12 months. other card fees are transaction-based and are recognized on the transaction date. the bank operates various loyalty points programs, which allow customers to accumulate points when using the bank’s products and services. loyalty point liabilities are subject to periodic remeasurement to reflect the expected cost of redemption. where the customer has the option to redeem points for statement credits, the cost of the loyalty program is presented net of card fees. where points can only be redeemed for goods or services, interchange revenue allocated to the loyalty rewards is recognized when the rewards are redeemed. reward costs are recorded in non-interest expenses. banking services fees consist of fees earned on personal, business and government deposit activities. personal deposit-related fees consist of account maintenance and various transaction-based services. business and government deposit-related fees consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services and other cash management services. these fees are recognized on the transaction date or over time as services are provided to the customer. credit fees include fees earned for providing letters of credit and guarantee, loan commitments, bankers’ acceptances, and for arranging loan syndications. these fees are recognized on the transaction date or over time as services are provided based on contractual agreements with the customer. mutual funds fees include management and administration fees which are earned in the bank’s wealth management business. these fees are calculated as a percentage of the fund’s net asset value and recognized as the service is provided. from time to time, the bank may also recognize performance fees from some funds. these fees are only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. brokerage fees relate to fees earned for providing full-service and discount brokerage services to clients. these fees are contractually agreed and can be asset-based or linked to individual transactions. such fees are recognized as the service is provided to clients or on the trade date. investment management and trust fees include administration, trust services and other investment services provided to clients. these fees are contractually agreed upon and can be linked to portfolio values or individual transactions. such fees are recognized as the service is provided to clients to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. underwriting and other advisory fees relate to fees earned for services provided to clients in relation to the placement of debt and equities. such fees also include services to clients for mergers, acquisitions, financial restructurings and other corporate finance activities. these fees are recognized when the service has been performed and/or contractual milestones are completed. performance and completion fees are variable consideration and generally contingent on the successful completion of a transaction. other fees and commissions include commissions earned on the sale of third party insurance products to the bank’s customers. such fees and commissions are recognized when the performance obligation is completed. 162 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
fee and commission expenses fee and commission expenses relate to transaction and service fees which are expensed as the services are received. dividend income dividend income on equity securities is recognized when the bank’s right to receive payment is established, which is on the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities. share-based payments share-based payments awarded to employees are recognized as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of income over the vesting period based on the number of awards expected to vest, including the impact of expected forfeitures. for awards that are delivered in tranches, each tranche is considered a separate award and accounted for separately. plain vanilla options and other awards that must be settled for shares are classified as equity awards. equity-classified awards are expensed based on the grant date fair value with a corresponding increase to equity – other reserves in the consolidated statement of financial position. if an option is exercised, both the exercise price proceeds together with the amount recorded in other reserves is credited to equity – common shares in the consolidated statement of financial position. stock appreciation rights and other awards that must be settled for cash are classified as liabilities. liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date while they remain outstanding, with any changes in fair value recognized in compensation expense in the period. the liability is expensed over the vesting period which incorporates the remeasurement of the fair value and a revised forfeiture rate that anticipates units expected to vest. for plain vanilla options and stock appreciation rights, the bank estimates fair value using an option pricing model. the option pricing model requires inputs such as the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, expected volatility (calculated using an equal weighting of implied and historical volatility) and specific employee exercise behaviour patterns based on statistical data. for other awards, fair value is the quoted market price of the bank’s common shares at the reporting date. where derivatives are used to economically hedge share-based payment expense, related mark-to-market gains and losses are included in non-interest expenses – salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statement of income. dividends on shares dividends on common and preferred shares and other equity instruments are recognized as a liability and deducted from equity when they are declared and no longer at the discretion of the bank. segment reporting management’s internal view is the basis for the determination of operating segments. the operating segments are those whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the bank’s chief operating decision-maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. the bank has four operating segments: canadian banking, international banking, global wealth management and global banking and markets. the other category represents smaller operating segments, including group treasury and other corporate items, which are not allocated to an operating segment. these segments offer different products and services and are managed separately based on the bank’s management and internal reporting structure. the results of these business segments are based upon the internal financial reporting systems of the bank. the accounting policies used in these segments are generally consistent with those followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the bank. the only notable accounting measurement difference is the grossing up of revenues which are tax-exempt and income from associate corporations to an equivalent before-tax basis for those affected segments. this change in measurement enables comparison of income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. given the complexity of the bank, various estimates and allocation methodologies are used in the preparation of the business segment financial information. the funding value of assets and liabilities is transfer-priced at wholesale market rates, and corporate expenses are allocated to each segment on an equitable basis using various parameters. as well, capital is apportioned to the business segments on a risk-based methodology. transactions between segments are recorded within segment results as if conducted with a third-party and are eliminated on consolidation. earnings per share (eps) basic eps is computed by dividing net income for the period attributable to the bank’s common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. diluted eps is calculated by dividing adjusted net income for the period attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding for the period. in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, earnings are adjusted for changes in income or expenses that would result from the issuance of dilutive shares. the weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding for the period reflects the potential dilution that would occur if options, securities or other contracts that entitle their holders to obtain common shares had been outstanding from the beginning of the period (or a later date) to the end of the period (or an earlier date). instruments determined to have an antidilutive impact for the period are excluded from the calculation of diluted eps. the number of additional shares for inclusion in diluted eps for share-based payment options is determined using the treasury share method. under this method, the net number of incremental common shares is determined by assuming that in-the-money stock options are exercised and the proceeds are used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period. the number of additional shares associated with capital instruments that potentially result in the issuance of common shares is based on the terms of the contract. on occurrence of contingencies as specified in the non-viability contingent capital (nvcc) instruments, the number of additional common shares associated with the nvcc subordinated debentures, nvcc subordinated additional tier 1 capital notes, nvcc limited recourse capital notes and nvcc preferred shares is based on an automatic conversion formula as set out in the respective prospectus supplements. consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 163

are used in the ipv process. these sources include, but are not limited to, brokers, exchanges and pricing services. the valuation policies relating to the ipv process require that all pricing or rate sources used be external to the bank. at least annually, an independent assessment of pricing or rate sources is performed to determine the market presence and reliability of market levels. quoted prices are not always available for over-the-counter (otc) transactions as well as for transactions in inactive or illiquid markets. otc transactions are valued using internal models that maximize the use of observable inputs to estimate fair value. the chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. when fair value is based on all significant market observable inputs, the valuation is classified as level 2. financial instruments traded in a less active market can be valued using indicative market prices, the present value of cash flows or other valuation techniques. fair value estimates normally do not consider forced or liquidation sales. where financial instruments trade in inactive markets or when using models where observable parameters do not exist, significant management judgment is required for valuation methodologies and model inputs. valuations that require the significant use of unobservable inputs are considered level 3. the specific inputs and valuation techniques used in determining the fair value of financial instruments are noted below. for level 3 instruments, additional information is disclosed in the level 3 sensitivity analysis on page 169. the fair values of cash and deposits with banks, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, customers’ liability under acceptances, obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities lent, acceptances, and obligations related to securities sold short are assumed to approximate their carrying values, either due to their short-term nature or because they are frequently repriced to current market rates. trading loans trading loans are comprised of loans that serve as hedges to total return swaps, hedges for precious metal certificate liabilities and loans subject to sale through syndication. trading loans that serve as hedges to loan-based credit total return swaps and precious metals certificate liabilities are valued using consensus prices from bank approved independent pricing services. the fair value of loans subject to sale through syndication approximates their carrying value due to the short-term nature of these loans. government issued or guaranteed securities the fair values of government issued or guaranteed debt securities are primarily based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, where available. where quoted prices in active markets are not available, the fair value is determined by utilizing recent transaction prices, reliable broker quotes, or pricing services, which derive fair values using only observable valuation inputs, which are significant to the fair values. for securities for which quoted prices are not available, the bank uses a discounted cash flow method, using the effective yield of a similar instrument adjusted for instrument-specific risk factors that are observable inputs such as credit spread and contracted features. corporate and other debt corporate and other debt securities are valued using unadjusted quoted prices from independent market data providers or third-party broker quotes from an active market. where direct prices from active markets are not available, the valuation is performed with a yield-based valuation approach. in some instances, interpolated yields of similar bonds are used to price securities. the bank uses pricing models with observable inputs from market sources such as credit spread, and interest rate curves. these inputs are verified through an ipv process on a monthly basis. for certain securities where there is no active market, no consensus market pricing and no indicative or executable independent third-party quotes, the bank uses pricing by third-party providers or internal pricing models and cannot readily observe the significant inputs used to price such instruments. mortgage-backed securities the fair value of residential mortgage-backed securities is primarily determined using broker quotes and independent market data providers. in limited circumstances, an internal price-based model may be used with the unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value. equity securities the fair value of equity securities is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, where available. where equity securities are less frequently traded, the most recent exchange-quoted pricing is used to determine fair value. for private equity securities, where quoted prices in active markets are not readily available, the fair value is determined as a multiple of the underlying earnings or percentage of underlying net asset value obtained from third-party general partner statements. derivatives fair values of exchange-traded derivatives are based on unadjusted quoted market prices from an active market. fair values of over-the-counter (otc) derivatives or inactive exchange-traded derivatives are determined using pricing models, which take into account observable valuation inputs such as current market and contractual prices of the underlying instruments, as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions. the determination of the fair value of derivatives includes consideration of credit risk, estimated funding costs and ongoing direct costs over the life of the instruments. derivative products valued using a valuation technique with market-observable inputs mainly include interest rate swaps and options, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. the most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. the models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot, forward rates and interest rate curves. derivative products valued using a valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs, such as volatility, correlation, and forward curves, may include long dated contracts (interest rate swaps, currency swaps, option contracts, commodity contracts and certain credit default swaps) and other derivative products that reference a basket of assets. loans the estimated fair value of loans carried at amortized cost reflects changes in the general level of interest rates and creditworthiness of borrowers that have occurred since the loans were originated or purchased. the particular valuation methods used are as follows: • canadian fixed rate residential mortgages are fair valued by discounting the expected future contractual cash flows, taking into account expected prepayments and using management’s best estimate of average market interest rates currently offered for mortgages with similar remaining terms. consolidated

consolidated financial statements against established credit limits to the counterparty. pfe measures the effect that changes in the market have on derivative exposures throughout the lifetime of the counterparties’ trades. additionally, pfe considers risk mitigants such as netting and collateralization. pfe limits and utilization for derivatives counterparties are authorized and monitored by the bank’s risk management unit. 174 | 2024 scotiabank annual report the bank obtains the benefit of netting by entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties (typically industry standard international swaps and derivatives association (isda) agreements), which allow for a single net settlement of all transactions covered by that agreement in the event of a default or early termination of the transactions. in this manner, the credit risk associated with favourable contracts is eliminated by the master netting arrangement to the extent that unfavourable contracts with the same counterparty are not settled before favourable contracts. collateralization is typically documented by way of an isda credit support annex (csa), the terms of which may vary according to each party’s view of the other party’s creditworthiness. csas can require one party to post initial margin at the onset of each transaction. csas also allow for variation margin to be called if total uncollateralized mark-to-market exposure exceeds an agreed upon threshold. such variation margin provisions can be one way (only one party will ever post collateral) or bi-lateral (either party may post collateral depending upon which party is in-the-money). the csa will also detail the types of collateral that are acceptable to each party, and the adjustments that will be applied against each collateral type. the terms of the isda master netting agreements and csas are taken into consideration in the calculation of counterparty credit risk exposure (see also page 84 of the 2024 annual report). derivative instruments used by the bank include credit derivatives in its investment and loan portfolios: credit protection is sold as an alternative to acquiring exposure to bond or loan assets, and bought to manage or mitigate credit exposures. the following table summarizes the credit exposure of the bank’s derivative financial instruments. the credit risk amount (cra) represents the estimated replacement cost, or positive fair value, for all contracts. cra takes into account master netting or collateral arrangements that have been made1. cra does not reflect actual or expected losses. the credit equivalent amount (cea) is the exposure at default (ead) prescribed in the capital adequacy requirements (car) guidelines of the office of the superintendent of financial institutions (osfi). the risk-weighted asset is calculated by multiplying the cea by the capital requirement (k) times 12.5, where k is a function of the probability of default (pd), loss given default (lgd), maturity and prescribed correlation factors."

consolidated financial statements equity risk equity risk is created by the bank’s share-based compensation plans awarded to employees. in cash flow hedges, total return swaps are mainly used to offset the equity exposure by exchanging interest payments for payments based on the returns on the underlying shares. for all of the risks identified above, the economic relationship and hedge ratio are determined using a qualitative and quantitative assessment. this assessment incorporates comparison of critical terms of the hedged and hedging item, and regression analysis. for regression analysis, a hedging relationship is considered highly effective when all of the following criteria are met: correlation between the variables in the regression is at least 0.8 or greater; slope of the regression is within a 0.8-1.25 range; and confidence level of the slope is at least 95%. the main sources of hedge ineffectiveness include the following: • the use of different discount curves to value the hedged item and the hedging derivative in fair value hedges, in order to reflect the reduced credit risk of collateralized derivatives; • differences in key terms such as the underlying reference interest rate tenor, reset/settlement frequency and floating spread between the hedging instruments and the hedged item. the bank has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of ias 39. however, the bank has implemented the additional hedge accounting disclosures that are required by the ifrs 9 related amendments to ifrs 7 “financial instruments: disclosures”. the following table summarizes the notional amounts of derivatives and carrying amounts of"

consolidated financial statements the bank determines the carrying values of its cgus using a regulatory capital approach based on credit, market, operational risks and leverage, consistent with the bank’s capital attribution for business line performance measurement. corporate capital that is not directly attributable is allocated to each cgu on a proportional basis, based on the relative attributed capital prior to the corporate capital allocation. the resulting carrying amount determined for the cgu is then compared to its respective recoverable amount to identify any impairment. annual impairment testing for goodwill was performed as at july 31, 2024 and 2023, and no impairment was determined to exist. as of october 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no significant changes to this assessment. fair value less costs of disposal for all cgus other than latin america, the recoverable amount was determined using the fair value less costs of disposal (fvlcd) method. in arriving at fvlcd, the bank estimates the fair value of the cgu using price earnings (p/e) multiples applied to normalized net income for the last four quarters as of the test date, applies a control premium based on a weighted average of acquisition premiums paid globally in the banking industry over the past five years for comparable companies, and deducts the estimated costs of disposal. the fair value measurement is categorized as level 3 due to significant inputs being unobservable. for the 2024 annual impairment test, p/e multiples ranging from 11 to 11.5 times (2023 – 9 to 10 times) were used. the bank has performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions used in estimating fvlcd. the estimate of reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions are based on available evidence in respect of each input, such as risks associated with the normalized net income projections, and range of p/e multiples observed externally. reasonable negative changes in the net income outlook (decrease of 5%) or p/e multiples (decrease of 1x), each in isolation, holding other factors constant, would not result in impairment for all cgus using the fvlcd method. value in use the latin america cgu’s recoverable amount was determined using the value in use (viu) method, consistent with the prior year. in estimating viu, the bank uses a discounted cash flow valuation model based on a 5-year forecast of after-tax cash flows, the estimated terminal growth rate beyond 5 years, and the applicable discount rate. the 5-year cash flow forecast is based on management approved budgets and plans which consider market trends, macroeconomic conditions, forecasted earnings and the business strategy for the cgu. the terminal growth rate is based on long-term growth expectations in latin america, and the discount rate is based on the cost of capital of comparable companies. for the 2024 annual impairment test, a terminal growth rate of 3% (2023 – 3%) and a discount rate of 12% (2023 – 13%) was used. the bank has performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions used in estimating the latin america cgu’s viu. the estimate of reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions is based on available evidence in respect of each input such as historical performance against forecasts, risks associated with the underlying cash flow projections, and range of discount rates observed externally. reasonable negative changes in any one key assumption, holding other factors constant, would not result in impairment for the latin america cgu. 198 | 2024 scotiabank annual report

other plans operated by certain subsidiaries of the bank are not considered material and are not included in these disclosures. global pension plans the principal pension plans include plans in canada, u.s., mexico, uk, ireland, jamaica, trinidad & tobago and other countries in the caribbean in which the bank operates. the bank has a strong and well-defined governance structure to manage these global obligations. the investment policy for each principal plan is reviewed periodically and all plans are in good standing with respect to legislation and local regulations. actuarial valuations for funding purposes for the bank’s funded pension plans are conducted as required by applicable legislation. the purpose of the actuarial valuation is to determine the funded status of the plans on a going-concern and statutory basis and to determine the required contributions. the plans are funded in accordance with applicable pension legislation and the bank’s funding policies such that future benefit promises based on plan provisions are well secured. the assumptions used for the funding valuations are set by independent plan actuaries on the basis of the requirements of the local actuarial standards of practice and statutes. scotiabank pension plan (canada) the most significant pension plan is the scotiabank pension plan (spp) in canada, which includes a closed defined benefit (db) component. employees hired in canada on or after may 1, 2018 , participate in a defined contribution (dc) component only. as the administrator of the spp, the bank has established a well-defined governance structure and policies to maintain compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements under osfi and the canada revenue agency. the bank appoints a number of committees to oversee and make decisions related to the administration of the spp. certain committees are also responsible for the investment of the assets of the spp fund and for monitoring the investment managers and performance. • the human capital and compensation committee (hcob) of the board approves the charter of the pension administration and investment committee (paic), reviews reports, and approves the investment policy. the hcob also reviews and recommends any amendments to the spp to the board of directors. • paic is responsible for recommending the investment policy to the hcob, for appointing and monitoring investment managers, and for reviewing auditor and actuary reports. paic also monitors the administration of member pension benefits. • the scotiabank master trust committee (mtc) invests assets in accordance with the investment policy and all applicable legislation. the mtc assigns specific mandates to investment managers. • the capital accumulation plans (cap) committee is responsible for the administration and investment of the dc component of the spp including the selection and monitoring of investment options available to dc participants. actuarial valuations for funding purposes for the spp are conducted on an annual basis. the most recent funding valuation was conducted as of november 1, 2023. contributions are being made to the spp in accordance with this valuation and are shown in the table in b) below. the assumptions used for the funding valuation are set by independent plan actuaries on the basis of the requirements of the canadian institute of actuaries and applicable regulation. other benefit plans the principal other benefit plans include plans in canada, u.s., mexico, uruguay, uk, jamaica, trinidad & tobago, colombia and other countries in the caribbean in which the bank operates. the most significant other benefit plans provided by the bank are in canada. 210 | 2024 scotiabank annual report
key assumptions the financial information reported below in respect of pension and other benefit plans is based on a number of assumptions. the most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation, which is set by reference to the yields on high quality corporate bonds that have durations that match the terms of the bank’s obligations. separate discount rates are used to determine the annual benefit expense in canada and the u.s. these rates are determined with reference to the yields on high quality corporate bonds with durations that match the various components of the annual benefit expense. the discount rate used to determine the annual benefit expense for all other plans continues to be the same as the rate used to determine the defined benefit obligation. other assumptions set by management are determined in reference to market conditions, plan-level experience, best practices and future expectations. the key weighted-average assumptions used by the bank for the measurement of the benefit obligation and benefit expense for all of the bank’s principal plans are summarized in the table in f) below. risk management the bank’s defined benefit pension plans and other benefit plans expose the bank to a number of risks. some of the more significant risks include interest rate risk, investment risk, longevity risk and health care cost increases, among others. these risks could result in higher defined benefit expense and a higher defined benefit obligation to the extent that: • there is a decline in discount rates; and/or • plan assets returns are less than expected; and/or • plan members live longer than expected; and/or • health care costs are higher than assumed. in addition to the governance structure and policies in place, the bank manages risks by regularly monitoring market developments and asset investment performance. the bank also monitors regulatory and legislative changes along with demographic trends and revisits the investment strategy and/or plan design as warranted. a)"
217,217,h) assets,"october 31, by asset category.",notes_consolidated_finnacial_statement,"h) assets the bank’s principal pension plans’ assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of maximizing overall expected returns, at an acceptable level of risk relative to the benefit obligation. a key factor in managing long-term investment risk is asset mix. investing the pension assets across different asset classes and geographic regions helps to mitigate risk and to minimize the impact of declines in any single asset class, particular region or type of investment. investment managers – including related-party managers – are typically hired and assigned specific mandates within each asset class. pension plan asset mix guidelines are set for the long term and are documented in each plan’s investment policy. asset mix policy typically also reflects the nature of the plan’s benefit obligations. legislation places certain restrictions on asset mix – for example, there are usually limits on concentration in any one investment. other concentration and quality limits are also set forth in the investment policies. derivatives cannot be used without specific authorization; currently, the main uses of derivatives are for duration management and currency hedging. asset mix guidelines are reviewed at least once each year, and adjusted, where appropriate, based on market conditions and opportunities. however, large asset class shifts are not common, and typically reflect a change in the pension plan’s situation (e.g. plan amendments) and/or in the investment strategy. actual asset mix is reviewed regularly and rebalancing back to target asset mix is considered – as needed – generally on a semi-annual basis. the bank’s other benefit plans are generally not funded, with the exception of certain programs in mexico. the tables below show the weighted-average actual and target asset allocations for the bank’s principal plans at"

(a) credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honour its financial or contractual obligations to the bank. the bank’s credit risk appetite and credit risk policy are developed by its global risk management (grm) department and limits are reviewed and approved by the board on an annual and biennial basis, respectively. the credit risk appetite defines target markets and risk tolerances that are developed at an all-bank level, and then further refined at the business line level. the objectives of the credit risk appetite are to ensure that, for the bank, including the individual business lines: • target markets and product offerings are well defined; • the risk parameters for new underwritings and for the portfolios as a whole are clearly specified; and • transactions, including origination, syndication, loan sales and hedging, are managed in a manner to ensure the goals for the overall portfolio are met. the credit risk policy sets out, among other things, the credit risk rating systems and associated parameter estimates, the delegation of authority for granting credit, and the calculation of allowance for credit losses. it forms an integral part of enterprise-wide policies and procedures that encompass governance, risk management and control structure. the bank’s credit risk rating systems are designed to support the determination of key credit risk parameter estimates which measure credit and transaction risk. for non-retail exposures, parameters are associated with each credit facility through the assignment of borrower and facility ratings. borrower risk is evaluated using methodologies that are specific to particular industry sectors and/or business lines. the risk associated with facilities of a given borrower is assessed by considering the facilities’ structural and collateral-related elements. for retail portfolios, product specific models assign accounts into homogeneous segments using internal and external borrower/facility-level credit experience. this process provides for a meaningful differentiation of risk and allows for appropriate and consistent estimation of loss characteristics at the model and segment level. further details on credit risk relating to derivatives are provided in note 11(c). consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 223
consolidated financial statements (i) credit risk exposures credit risk exposures disclosed below are presented based on the basel framework utilized by the bank i.e., exposures subject to credit risk capital. the bank uses the internal ratings based approach (irb) for all material canadian, u.s., european portfolios, and for a significant portion of all international corporate and commercial portfolios. under the advanced internal ratings based (airb) approach, the bank uses internal risk parameter estimates, based on historical experience and appropriate margin of conservatism, for probability of default (pd), loss given default (lgd) and exposure at default (ead). under revised basel iii rules, there are new irb requirements for internally developed model parameters under airb, including scope restrictions which limit certain asset classes to only the foundation internal ratings based (firb) approach. for those asset classes (e.g., large corporates, banks, etc.) the firb approach utilizes the bank’s internally modeled pd parameters combined with internationally prescribed lgd and ead parameters. the remaining portfolios, including other individual portfolios, are treated under the standardized approach. under the standardized approach, credit risk is estimated using the risk weights as prescribed by the basel framework either based on credit assessments by external rating agencies or based on the counterparty type for non-retail exposures and product type for retail exposures. standardized risk weights also take into account other factors such as specific provisions for defaulted exposures, eligible collateral, and"

(iv) collateral collateral held in the normal course of business, to reduce its exposure to counterparty credit risk, the bank receives collateral for capital markets related activities. the following are examples of the terms and conditions customary to collateral for these types of transactions: • the risks and rewards of the pledged assets reside with the pledgor. • additional collateral is required when the market value of the transaction exceeds thresholds agreed upon with the pledgor. • the bank is normally permitted to sell or repledge the collateral it receives, although this right is specific to each agreement under which the collateral is pledged. • upon satisfaction of the obligation, the bank must return the pledged assets, unless the bank has the right to sell or repledge the collateral it receives, in which case the bank must return comparable collateral to the pledgor. as at october 31, 2024, the approximate market value of cash and securities collateral accepted that may be sold or repledged by the bank was $359 billion (2023 – $315 billion). this collateral is held primarily in connection with reverse repurchase agreements, margin loans, securities lending and derivative transactions. the bank also borrows securities under standard securities borrowing agreements that it is able to re-pledge. including these borrowed securities, the approximate market value of securities collateral accepted that may be sold or re-pledged was $300 billion (2023 – $313 billion), of which approximately $60 billion was not sold or re-pledged (2023 – $75 billion). collateral pledged in the normal course of business, securities and other assets are pledged to secure an obligation, participate in clearing or settlement systems, or operate in a foreign jurisdiction. note 35(c) details the nature and extent of the bank’s asset pledging activities. asset pledging transactions are conducted under terms that are common and customary to standard derivative, securities financing, and other borrowing activities. standard risk management controls are applied with respect to asset pledging. assets acquired in exchange for loans the carrying value of assets acquired in exchange for loans as at october 31, 2024 was $312 million (2023 – $334 million) mainly comprised of real estate and was classified as either held for sale or held for use as appropriate. consolidated financial statements 2024 scotiabank annual report | 227
consolidated financial statements (b) liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the bank is unable to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner at reasonable prices. the bank’s liquidity risk is subject to extensive risk management controls and is managed within the framework of policies and limits approved by the board. the board receives reports on risk exposures and performance against approved limits. the asset-liability committee (alco) provides senior management oversight of liquidity risk. the key elements of the bank’s liquidity risk management framework include: • liquidity risk measurement and management limits, including limits on maximum net cash outflow by currency over specified short-term horizons; • prudent diversification of its wholesale funding activities by using a number of different funding programs to access the global financial markets and manage its maturity profile, as appropriate; • large holdings of liquid assets to support its operations, which can generally be sold or pledged to meet the bank’s obligations; • liquidity stress testing, including bank-specific, global-systemic, and combination systemic/bank-specific scenarios; and • liquidity contingency planning. the bank’s foreign operations have liquidity management frameworks that are similar to the bank’s framework. local deposits are managed from a liquidity risk perspective based on the local management frameworks and regulatory requirements. (i) commitments to extend credit in the normal course of business, the bank enters into commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or other financings for specific amounts and maturities, subject to specific conditions. these commitments, which are not reflected on the consolidated statement of financial position, are subject to normal credit standards, financial controls and monitoring procedures. (ii) derivative instruments the bank is subject to liquidity risk relating to its use of derivatives to meet customer needs, generate revenues from trading activities, manage market and credit risks arising from its lending, funding and investment activities, and lower its cost of capital. the maturity profile of the notional amounts of the bank’s derivative instruments is summarized in note 11(b). (c) market risk market risk arises from changes in market prices and rates (including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices), the correlations between them, and their levels of volatility. market risk is subject to extensive risk management controls, and is managed within the framework of market risk policies and limits approved by the board. the alco and market risk management and policy committee oversee the application of the framework set by the board, and monitor the bank’s market risk exposures and the activities that give rise to these exposures. the bank uses a variety of metrics and models to measure and control market risk exposures. the measurements used are selected based on an assessment of the nature of risks in a particular activity. the principal measurement techniques are value at risk (var), stress testing, sensitivity analysis and simulation modeling. the board reviews results from these metrics quarterly. models are independently validated internally prior to implementation and are subject to formal periodic review. var is a statistical measure that estimates the potential loss in value of the bank’s trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. the quality of the bank’s var is validated by regular back testing analysis, in which the var is compared to theoretical and actual profit and loss results. to complement var, the bank also uses stress testing to examine the impact that abnormally large swings in market factors and periods of prolonged inactivity might have on trading portfolios. the stress testing program is designed to identify key risks and ensure that the bank’s capital can absorb potential losses from abnormal events. the bank subjects its trading portfolios to a series of stress tests on a daily basis. in trading portfolios, sensitivity analysis is used to measure the effect of changes in risk factors, including prices and volatility, on financial products and portfolios. in non-trading portfolios, sensitivity analysis assesses the effect of changes in interest rates on current earnings and on the economic value of equity. simulation modeling under various scenarios is particularly important for managing risk in the deposit, lending and investment products the bank offers to its retail customers. (i) non-trading interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk of loss due to the following: changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve; the volatility of interest rates and changes in customer preferences (e.g. mortgage prepayment rates). the bank actively manages its interest rate exposures with the objective of protecting net interest income within established risk tolerances. interest rate risk arising from the bank’s funding and investment activities is managed in accordance with board-approved policies and global limits, which are designed to control the risk to net interest income and economic value of equity. the income limit measures the effect of a specified shift in interest rates on the bank’s annual net interest income over the next twelve months, while the economic value limit measures the impact of a specified change in interest rates on the present value of the bank’s net assets. these calculations are based on models that consider a number of inputs and are on a constant balance sheet and make no assumptions for management actions that may mitigate the risk. interest rate sensitivity based on the bank’s interest rate positions, the following table shows the pro-forma pre-tax impact on the bank’s net interest income over the next twelve months and economic value of equity of an immediate and sustained 100 basis points increase and decrease in interest rates across major currencies as defined by the bank. these calculations are based on models that consider a number of inputs and are on a constant balance sheet and"
231,231,(ii) non-trading foreign currency risk,bank’s var by risk factor:,notes_consolidated_finnacial_statement,"(ii) non-trading foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk of loss due to changes in spot and forward rates, and the volatility of currency exchange rates. non-trading foreign currency risk, also referred to as structural foreign exchange risk, arises primarily from the bank’s net investments in self-sustaining foreign operations and is controlled by a board-approved limit. this limit considers potential volatility to shareholders’ equity as well as the potential impact on capital ratios from foreign exchange fluctuations. on a quarterly basis, the asset-liability committee (alco) reviews the bank’s exposures to these net investments. the bank may fully or partially hedge this exposure by funding the investments in the same currency, or by using other financial instruments, including derivatives. the bank is subject to foreign currency risk on the earnings of its foreign operations. to manage this risk, foreign currency revenues and expenses, which are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars, are projected over a number of future fiscal quarters. the alco assesses economic data and forecasts to decide on the portion of the estimated future foreign currency revenues and expenses to hedge. hedging instruments normally include foreign currency spot and forward contracts, as well as foreign currency options and swaps. as at october 31, 2024, a one percent increase (decrease) in the canadian dollar against all currencies in which the bank operates decreases (increases) the bank’s before-tax annual earnings by approximately $45 million (october 31, 2023 – $63 million) in the absence of hedging activity, due primarily from exposure to u.s. dollars from the bank’s operations in the u.s. and activities conducted internationally in this currency and from exposures to latin american currencies. a similar change in the canadian dollar as at october 31, 2024 would increase (decrease) the unrealized foreign currency translation losses in the accumulated other comprehensive income in equity by approximately $324 million (2023 – $356 million), net of hedging. (iii) non-trading equity risk equity risk is the risk of loss due to adverse movements in equity prices. equity price risk is often classified into two categories: general equity risk, which refers to the sensitivity of an instrument or portfolio’s value to changes in the overall level of equity prices, and specific equity risk, which refers to that portion of an individual equity instrument’s price volatility that is determined by entity-specific characteristics. the bank is exposed to equity risk through its equity investment portfolios, which are controlled by board-approved portfolio and var limits. equity investments include common and preferred shares, as well as a diversified portfolio of third-party managed funds. the majority of the bank’s equity investment portfolios are managed by group treasury under the strategic direction of the alco. group treasury delegates the management of a portion of equity and equity-related portfolios to other external fund managers to take advantage of these fund managers’ expertise in particular market niches and products. the fair value of equity securities designated at fvoci is shown in note 13.
